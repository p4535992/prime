## Introduction

### The World We Live In

The world we live in is one of magic and excitement. Cities and towns cover the various continents of our world as civilizations everywhere try and make some sense of the lives they live. The fall of the Nerathi Empire was roughly 300 years ago and that can only mean one thing. Civilizations and races are fighting for power. An impending war faces our time.
