## Introduction

### The World We Live In

The world we live in is one of magic and excitement. Cities and towns cover the various continents of our world as civilizations everywhere try and make some sense of the lives they live. The fall of the Nerathi Empire was roughly 300 years ago and that can only mean one thing. Civilizations and races are fighting for power. An impending war faces our time.

It's been over 100 years since the Starfire Calamity. And over 90 years since we've heard from the gods...

### The Quest for Starfire's Gaze

In 2010, my gaming group started our first campaign. In 2017, we finished it. They defeated the Tomb of Horrors. They defeated Orcus. They defeated the Tarrasque. For 30 levels, they tracked a man named Starfire building a machination named "Starfire's Gaze".

It was one of the single, greatest experiences of my life. You'll find the notes/characters from that campaign throughout. Enjoy.

### Journey's End

“Nearing the journey’s end, the companions find themselves in a sun washed glade. Enemies far behind them, a collective sigh pays homage to the welcome respite. As the sun nestles down to its own slumber, the night transforms glory into solemn retrospect.

Riches and acclaim have they gained in plenty but dear friends have been lost on the path from home to here. In the flicker of firelight stories of a life well lived bring laughter and tears, sorrow’s price is paid in their remembrance.

Mourning will commence at the beginning of next turn.

Roll for initiative."
