# Harpam Halandor

From the musical writings of Eldon Orla, bard by trade, inspiration by right:

>“The flame extinguished, the hope of man gone. The shadow swept across the land. Nightfall for all mankind. Yet the morning came. The sun rose over Isle Dragor pushing back the darkness. Halandor’s Courage, like the morning sun, pushed back the eternal darkness that we may have peace. And now the world sits broken. A sword has been shattered but thanks to Halandor’s Courage, not destroyed. Let him rise above the rest, as he passes to eternity.”
