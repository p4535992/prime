â€œSome say that there is a Tavern at the Edge of the World,

I know no reason that it should not be.

In the tales that they tell that have all swirled,

No one flocks to it and none do flee.

---

I know of this Tavern at the Edge of World,

Where heroes and saints do gather around.

It will last until the last pages have curled,

And the last of the kings has been crowned.

---

Across the room from the heroes and saints,

Sit the vilest villains, all plans unfurled.

Yet all sit together without any complaints,

At the Tavern at the Edge of the World.

---

When your songs have been sung and your stories told,

And the last lady of the dance has been twirled,

You may find yourself retired and getting old,

Spending your last at the Tavern at the Edge of the World."

*Last refuge by [Piotr Dura](https://www.artstation.com/threedee).*

At the farthest point from civilization, there is a Tavern at the Edge of the World. The large wooden door creaks open and a hero walks in. The sword at his waist clanks against the plate armor he bears. Covered in sweat, dirt, and blood from his last battle, the sight is anything but inspiring. Fatigue lines the face of this once-proud warrior. He slowly makes his way to the bar.

He taps the bar twice. No words need be spoken at the Tavern at the Edge of the World. The sound of a glass mug sliding across the wooden bar immediately follows his signal. The frothy ale sloshes over the side and onto the bar a little as the hero reaches into his pocket and pulls out a silver chain bag that he drops on the counter and he takes his ale. Platinum pieces and astral diamonds scatter out of the bag and across the bar. More money falls out of the bag than most people see in a lifetime. No one blinks twice.

The hero makes his way to the nearest table. Slowly and painfully he bends his legs to sit before collapsing into the chair. He is flooded with more relief than he has felt since he very first picked up a sword. For this is truly rest. No more battles will follow. He sits in silence with his eyes closed for awhile. Finally, rest. When he opens his eyes, he reaches for the ale but notices a familiar face across the room. Sitting alone with his own ale is a vile villain that the hero had conquered so many times during their lives; an eternal battle that neither ever thought would end. The villain was staring into his ale. He looked like the hero felt.

Then they made eye contact. Neither showed any malice or strong emotion. Only understanding this time. Their war was over. They were now the same. Both raised a glass to the other as they let the ale flow through them like their stories would flow through centuries and the ages. Only one of their stories would never be told. Only one would remain theirs. The story of the Tavern at the Edge of the World.
