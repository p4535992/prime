## Starfire's Calamity by [Leoven Mharki](/Characters/LeovenMharki.md)

Various scrolls spoke of a prophecy and one named Starfire. They were collectively known as the [Scroll of the Stars](#Scroll-of-the-Stars). The first was found beneath the mountains near Minora by a group that would become known as the God's Chosen.

"The Starfire Calamity" oft refers to the specific event in which, it is claimed, that Starfire's machination tore apart the fabric of space-time and nearly sending the worlds as we know them into oblivion. See other works as to the nature of his machination, for I care not for its details.

I deem the "True Starfire Calamity" to be two-fold. The irresponsible acolyte known as Starfire, displayed the true power of his machination not once. But twice. Once, near Ashfilar in the Astral plane. The other, the well-documented theory I mentioned before. The first, I presume was a test. But it tore at the fabric of our universe, exposing us to another dimension: the Far Realm.

The incursion of Mind Flayers on Ashfilar and into our universe explains the heightened activity of the species throughout the Underdark.

## Scroll of the Stars by the Magus Prime

>…and as they shine from the heavens, they reveal the magnificent power within. Each and every one reveals the secrets they have withheld over a thousand lifetimes. Seemingly fixed, they watch over this world and all others. Their power surpasses all understanding.

It was only a matter of time before one turned his eyes upward looking for the power within. We just never thought it would happen so suddenly. Even more frightening, word is spreading like wildfire that he succeeded. I cannot imagine what it could do. It should have never been attempted. Should it fall into the hands of the likes of Orcus…that would be the end. There is no question in my mind.

We must never assume, however. Starfire could have not succeeded at all. But knowing him, a great fear rises up within me.

---

…too long has it been since word came. Too long since his departure. Every day creates a new wrinkle in the puzzle of time. Every day I wait, adds to the fear I have.

One hundred years ago he set out on a trail I told him I would not follow. That did not stop him. Rumors have come of his whereabouts. Rumors have come of his accomplishments and feats. Rumors have come of his demise. I know not what to believe but something tells me he is not dead. No, not Starfire.

My most credible sources tell me that his journeys have taken him to the Astral Sea. He has been seen in the Bright City of Hestavar. This brings great joy to me if he has indeed made it. But it also brings great distress. That could mean he is closer to completing what he set out to do.

Whatever the matter, I must have patience. He will return. He never goes back on his word…

### A Note on Starfire

Starfire thought to be a title, passed along through generations. Each iteration of Starfire, is working towards building something, recently referred to as "Starfire's Gaze". We only know its power and that it's likely related to Erathis's "Game of Making."

The Starfire referred to throughout this text, refers to an individual whose efforts culminated around 207 AN.

---

Starfire worked to collect hoards of magical items. He is said to have had plans for a machine that required their parts and their various magics.

Around 200 AN, his efforts became more well-known, more bold. He was successfully procuring ancient, historical artifacts of legend. Scholars became worried. As did the gods. The rumors of his machine, the "Gaze", were that it could rival the power of the gods. It was a weapon. It could see through time. All of these rumors gained foothold.

We know this, it stole energy from the stars. We don't know how. We can only theorize why. But it did.

A single, credible account tells us the truth about the Starfire Calamity:

>"[Iosphael](/Characters/Iosphael.md), the worldbreaker descended upon us.
>
>Starfire said to us, 'The Gaze can still defeat him. Without it, he will consume our world. Allow me to fire it. One. Last. Time.'
>
>We had little choice. We knew it was the truth. We fired that weapon. And it changed everything." - Silmarien

We know little of how it affected Iosphael but its presence has not been noticed since, so we assume it dead. What comes next is speculation. No one understands these exact moments.

### The Calamity

The Gaze tore through the universe, nothing able to stop it. Slowly, the Arch shattered. The Arch refers to the worlds, planes, and the magical Weave that flows between them all. The World Axis, the arrangement of the Arch, was built before the very gods and primordials. No records exist of that time.

Planes were ripped from reality and thrown into the nothingness of space-time. The gods were helpless to save it - the end was here. Yet, something happened. The Arch rearranged itself. The cosmology warped and changed until the Great Wheel was born. We're still attempting to learn and define the Great Wheel.

However, the Weave, once guided by divine magic, was now free...and dangerous. Practitioners of magic saw the new raw power of it, and the inherent changes and danger it brought to any magic user.
