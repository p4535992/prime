## Dawnforge Mountain Collapse

From Wulfgen Stonefist:

The sun rose as it always does over the Dawnforge Mountains near Hammerfast. The days after Calastryx have been wonderfully peaceful, until now. First came the quakes. The ground rattled and shook as the vibrations grew. Rockslides fell from the peaks and trees became uprooted. I watched as the entire mountainside opened up and drew the mountain into the earth. I turned heel and ran, never looking back. I rest now in Fallcrest. No one believes me. They call me Wulfgen the Mad. I have a feeling that they will soon see just how “mad” I really am…

## Terror in the Nentir Vale

Message delivered to the Lord Warden of Fallcrest with no signature:

To Lord Warden Faren Markelhay,
I pray to the gods that this reaches someone. Winterhaven will be gone by my estimates when this does. It devoured the farms first and then made its way to the city. The western half is gone! Send no one for it is too late for us. Save yourselves and run! Pray and run!

## Battle for the Sand Marches

From the mouth of Balkrath the Bold as written by Plinius:

The Battle for the Sand Marches was a victory for King Blackstone and the Rising Lands. A small group including two humans, two elves, and a dwarf assisted the King in his victory. As the gods have seen it, the Az’Rulean pass is now clear thanks to the same group. Glory is Kord’s this day!

## Maransan War Update

The war in Maransa has taken an unfortunate turn. Just as [King Tristan Blackstone](/Characters/TristanBlackstone.md) reached the western edge and conquered Arna, Maransa unleashed terror upon the battlefield with the appearance of a red dragon. Blackstone’s army continues to see victory in many battles but when the dragon is involved, they are not so lucky.

[Kraenage](/Atlas/Kandalur/Realms/Maransa/Settlements/Kraenage.md) is currently under siege from Blackstone’s forces out of Arna. [Maransa](/Atlas/Kandalur/Realms/Maransa/Settlements/Maetrage.md) has pulled many forces from the Bleeding Edge but Blackstone refuses to reduce his presence there.

Blackstone has thus far failed to reach Maetrage although he has made many attempts. The force remains strongest around the Jewel in the Sand. The dragon’s presence is also strongest in the surrounding area of the city. The war is anyone’s to claim up to this point but unless the dragon is handled…it will soon become apparent that it is already over.

## The Disappearing Shipment

To King Blackstone

Subject: Missing Shipment

Your Grace, I have received ill news from one of my caravan guards who had been travelling with your recent shipment from the Nentir Vale that you personally requested.

First I would like to make it clear that though you hired my guard, one made note of the weaponry and general skill of the caravan members themselves. Though it seems in ill taste I must make certain that I am well compensated for the 1-1 ratio of guards to caravan members that I pride myself upon when making shipments.

However, the true problem is that overnight the caravan itself seemed to have been entirely ransacked and the members of the caravan captured. My guards awoke one morning, a days ride from Risencrest, to find the wagons, cargo and all, destroyed. As well as every member of the caravan completely missing. My guards claim no personal injury, but I must admit my complete bafflement as to what could have happened. To this end I must once again ensure that my compensation is forthcoming for though the shipment did not “officially” arrive, the guards did make true on their word to accompany it at least most of the way to Risencrest. As the boxes were quite light, I assume the contents could not be particularly valuable goods being shipped, so I do not feel that a dock in pay is necessary.

If you have any questions or concerns with my request for compensation in full, I am at your disposal, and I pray you decide to use my services should you require a shipment delivered again.

Sincerely,

Garl Thondak, Principal Caravan Supervisor for the Darkwyrm Shipping Co.

To Garl Thondak,

You shall receive your compensation in full, as well as a discretionary sum to prevent your mentioning of this shipment to any interested parties. If word were to get out of this shipment to any interested parties, then word could potentially leak as to the ability of the guards of the Darkwyrm Shipping Company’s to protect the goods being shipped. We thank you for your cooperation and will contact you if we have further need of your services.

Ean Darklight, Steward to King Tristan Blackstone of Risencrest

To Ean Darklight

Pleasure doing business with you.

Garl Thondak, Principal Caravan Supervisor for the Darkwyrm Shipping Co.

## Barbarian Invasions

The following is an excerpt from a message sent from Grennal to Raignoria:

To the Most High Council:

With barbarians laying siege to Asalia, the turmoil in the cascades, and now the added threat of barbarian invasions from the west, our numbers grow far too thin. We do not have the garrison to patrol our entire borders both night and day. We need more men. The High Council must act soon or the war will break through our borders and the tides of darkness will sweep over our land, even unto Raignoria. Time is of the essence.

-Rolen, of Grennal

The following is an excerpt from the personal journal of Sithek, Commander of the Western Patrol:

Entry #3 of the New Moon

Something isn’t right. First the barbarians were coming in raiding parties, but now they are coming droves. They have been worked into a frenzy and they come by the hundreds screaming and crying as if they were being chased by death itself. With so few under my command I am unable to turn them all aside. I have been forced to send search parties to weed them out and drive them from our lands. We cannot escape this war forever, the High Council must see this. The war is creeping in on all fronts and soon it will be on our doorstep.

Entry #5 of the New Moon

Late this evening one of the search parties came back with a bound male crying and wringing his hands. He was covered in blood, but it was not his blood. My men tell me that they found him crouching in a bloody mess with a knife in his hands. His family lay about him, all their eyes were open and full of fear. Blood trickled from the corners of their mouths and a jagged wound was opened from ear to ear. I tried to calm him and interrogate him, but he only offered two words. Darkness and Death. More of my men are hearing whispers of the Vampire Clans raiding the Barbarian villages. This cannot be true. The Prince of Arna drove them from the mountains and burned their King. Time will tell, for now I have my orders, but if the High Council will not give me more men…may the Gods be with us. A horn blast in the distance, at this hour? I must see to this…

Thus ends the last entry in Sithek’s Journal.
