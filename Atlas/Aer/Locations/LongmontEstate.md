### Items of Interest
#### The Old Man
The old man,

His skin browned and leathered by time,

Furrows his brow with a constant worry

> *“my dear girl where have you gone,*

> *I can only miss you…”*

His mind gone

Not unsound,

but somewhere else entirely.

A sadness dwells within his eyes,

blinded by anger, fear, sadness.

Decades of constant sorrow,

Dancing across a sea of unfathomable grief.

> *“and they would take her for committing this blasphemy.”*

Names unknown, deeds uncertain.

Something was done that could not be undone.

Someone was taken, not returned.

He is now the Wanderer. Only seeking that which was lost to him.

Never ceasing his crusade. Every spoken word devoted to his cause.

The old man and his words…his memories.

##### Notes
After being in the company of The Old Man for a short while, Gryff was compelled by this figure. The Old Man seems only concerned with one thing and it seems to constantly weigh on his mind. Gryff can’t help but feel some sort of sadness for the Old Man and has begun to write about him.

#### Tome of the Stoic Stones
*Gather, brothers of chaos. Drum up the ancient words and bring forth the darkness. Word has come from across the world. The Aspect lives! The one great god is not lost. Brothers from around the world gather each and every night and chant the ancient words and channel the power to him.*

*His day will come but rejoice knowing that his Aspect survives in the Shattered Kingdoms of Kandalur. It is but another realization of his true power. Speak the words. Perform the rituals. We will break his chains.*

#### Tales of Strife
Tales of Strife is a book written about the hard times and strife of the peoples of Silverkeep during the Dorgoth Invasion. Only about a dozen copies were made and most are in libraries. It is quite a boring read for anyone who did not experience the events firsthand.
#### The Game of Man and Woman
*Written in Sylvan.*

The “Game” is a compilation of ancient tales of lovers and how they played the “Game” set forth by the gods of the world. The “Game” has winners and losers and the tales of both are contained within this tome. About 29 copies of this tome are thought to exist in the world. A few are in libraries but sages would love to get their hands on one.
#### When the Morning Bell Rang
A tale of the earliest and bravest of the Bardic Brothers.
#### Maldur's Bane
To the reader of this tome:

My name is Archibald Smithers. If you found this within a haunted house on an unknown isle, then I am dead. But my mission was achieved. This book was planted as a warning.

Vahn Maldur was a noble that lived over 200 years ago. His wealth and estates are well known throughout Aer. All except this one. The haunted house mentioned above is home to Vahn Maldur and his thralls. I believe that he contracted Sanguinare Vampiris. I’ve lost many a friend who came to this house looking for treasure or the secret amongst the rumors. No one has returned from this place.

Heed my words: Flee. Vahn Maldur is likely to be more powerful than even the Shield of Aer. I pray this tome leads you to a better ending than previous visitors to this lost estate. Take the information I’ve tucked into the other pages of this tome and provide it to someone that can end this horror.

Rumor has it, the Dreadmount houses a long lost artifact that defeated vampire lords of old…

*Archibald Smithers*

*Upon a quick examination, there must be a lower level to the estate. That is where I’m certain Vahn Maldur is waiting.*

#### Songs of Lehir
Written by the famed Lehir, this Epic Poem follows the protagonist known only as “the Roamer” throughout the known world as he conquers giants, devils, and necromancers amongst others.

After the Guardians drove the forces of darkness deep into Malandia, the Roamer set out for home which appears to be somewhere in the Aesir. He crosses the Sea of First Light while reflecting on the victory over the darkness. He muses about the mysterious Isle of Issus as he is passing through the Forging Foothills but decides against heading to it.

During a violent storm, he and his guide are harassed by mountain giants but they quickly outsmart the brutes by lighting fires and then abandoning them. As the giants follow the trail of glowing flames, the Roamer and his guide escape up into the World’s Edge.

The Roamer and his guide crossed the World’s Edge with the help of the “little folk living in the mountains.” He passed into Nalia and deep in the rainforest, the Haeronyi. They stumbled across a strange camp at night but kept their distance. Here we have the one and only dialogue spoken by the protagonist. “If I had known fear, it was here. Terror, forevermore.” The protagonist is referring to ancient and frightening idols being worshiped in the camp by strangely dressed men. Days later and miles away, the Roamer still has trouble forgetting what he saw that night.

The Epic continues into Nalia, where the lands are more beautiful than anywhere in the world. It is a remnant of the long forgotten Feywild. But with beauty comes tragedy, as is the balance of life. The Roamer loses his guide to a wild maurdbeast. He managed to tame and train the creature after injuring it in the fight. Then the struggle began. Should he kill the beast that killed his friend? Or should he forgive and forge on with this new friend? He stared at the two planets in the night sky and wondered.

##### Gryff's Notes

>"Lehir also wrote Semitri Terrios which translates as the Song of Terror. This hidden tome refers to a dark power known as Rhanvir."

#### The Golden Key
*Written by Gryff Longmont for my love, Addylyn:*

One day, I will melt all gold on earth

And make a wonderful key with it all

This special key of remarkable worth

Will be fit to unlock your heart and soul

The bittings will work like a smile

Like a lawine of sweet and loving words

I will turn that key in a gentle style

And happy thoughts will fly to you as birds

A simple turn of the sweet golden key

Just like a wonder, magic wondrous and true

Will cause, for everyone to hear and see

A wave of peace and happiness in you

Let’s dream of a universe filled with love

And we may get a key from High Above

#### Gryff's Journal
Sun’s Day…I think….

*I can’t be for sure how much time has passed since I was last able to write. Our journey has taken us rather quickly out of Cordyr’s Coast and northwards to Manzir. An interesting city to say the least. We tried to book passage across the Sea of First Light but met some complications. I made the call to travel north through Malandia to stay away from prying eyes and unwanted followers. It turned out to be disastrous. We were attacked by Gnolls not long into our journey and were then waylaid by a dragon. It was in that fight that my dear friend Jamel fell victim to the Dragon’s wrath. Luckily, we had two men traveling with us since Cordyr’s coast. Their knowledge of the land proved invaluable. They led us to relative safety in a place called…well I don’t know if I should even write it down. There I met an eladrin who was older than I thought possible. He said there was a way to revive Jamel, and I will do everything I can to make sure that happens. So, here we are sat in the Crypt of Kings, bandaging our wounds and resting our limbs after only the first chamber. I feel as if this might be the death of me. I will go to the edge of oblivion to bring my dear friend Jamel back. Oh yes, I would be sore to forget the gem we picked up in that oasis in the chaos fields. Quaero’s new play thing… She is a pious bitch who constantly reminds everyone of what a pious bitch she is. From the looks of her one would think she would be useful in a fight…however, I have not seen any evidence of that. She is lousy in a fight and not thankful for the help she receives. Myself, quaero and our new friend Do-Mini have all aided her and for what? More griping and finger pointing. I will just let her die next time.*

Moon’s Day- Date Unknown

*“Much has happened since my last entry. We journeyed all the way North and West to bustling city of Cordyr’s Coast. That place is much more than the simple coastal town it pretends to be. In a matter of days I had already caught the attention of the Lord Warden. I must tread carefully from this point forward. I have come back to Cliffhall to pay some debt. On the way back, the Old Man, whose name is apparently Jamel, somehow miraculously remembered the art of intelligent speech. Thank the Gods. We also took a boy, Quero, I think his name was. In the short time we have been together, I have come to like him. He’s soft spoken and a hell of a shot. Maybe we will keep him around for awhile."*

“We lost Podric. There was a brief but bloody fight between we three and some priests who acted like they knew the old man. In the chaos it seems Podric was injured, and bled out while the old man and myself cleared the room. It’s a shame, as I was starting to grow fond of him.”

*“My thoughts constantly stray back to Hearn where my beloved Addylyn waits for me. I hope that in the next couple years I can accumulate enough wealth to prove to Vikos that I am so much more than a scoundrel. I will buy a villa in the countryside, buy her the nicest clothes and jewels, and finally prove to that old bag of bones that Addylyn and I were made for each other.”*

*“I can’t help but feel a deep sympathy for the old man. In his eyes I see a sorrow that goes beyond this world. A sadness that occupies the entirety of his being. He can only speak of this girl and the thing that she did, or he did, I can’t really tell. He is the physical manifestation of my unfathomable longing for Addylyn. If I can help him, I will. Who knows, maybe by helping him I might ease the sorrow that, daily, assaults my heart.”*

*“My ring was recently taken from me. I don’t know how the old bastard did it! It was in the pouch that no one knows that I have. He is a master and I hope I can learn from him one day. I have my ring again, but Banto questioned me about it. This is very peculiar.”*
