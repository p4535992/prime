# Shadowfell

The Shadowfell, also called the Dark World by common folk, is a dimension of black, gray, and white where most other color has been leached from everything. It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars.

The Dark World overlaps the Material Plane in much the same way as the Elder World. Aside from the colorless landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane. Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped â€“ distorted reflections of what exists on the Material Plane.
