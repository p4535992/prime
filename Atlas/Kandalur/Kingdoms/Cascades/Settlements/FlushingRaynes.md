## Histories

The House of Rayne was once the greatest of the houses of Men, having at the time of their coming to this region, a fortune of both arms and gold beyond any mortals reckoning.
>“For the most part they were tall people, with flaxen or golden hair and blue-grey eyes, but there were not a few among them that had dark hair, though all were fair-skinned.”

The People of Rayne were “quick to wrath and laughter, fierce in battle, generous to friend and to foe, swift in resolve, fast in loyalty, joyous in heart, they were known as the Golden Ones in the youth of Mankind.” They were akin to the house Morlin.

The vanguard of the Greater Folk, now led by one Marach, were the first to reach the The Everwinter, but they were daunted by the heights and turned southward, seeking a way round the Mountains. Thus they came to Asalia from the North when the other Houses had already settled. Marach therefore led his people to the plains just below the Grey Mountains, where they settled to the east of the Folk of Aegrias, the dragonborn.

The House of Rayne became the most renowned of the Cascades, fighting for the people of Aegrias and those of the Realm of the Vines to the west. They were moreover hardy to endure cold and feared not at times to go far into the north and there keep watch upon the movements of Vampiric forces. 

A great battle with an ancient house far in the north all but destroyed this once glorious house. The remnant of the House of Rayne was then put to thraldom; those able to work were taken to mines of the north or laboured as slaves for the Incomers, and the old were killed or driven out to starve. 

Vampiric’ lordship under Morgothian lasted nearly a century, until the Host of the Heroldi arrived in the [Cascades](../README.md) and the War of Wrath began. The remnants of the Houses then fought on the side of Heroldi’s Forces, and after the defeat of Morgothian, they were granted the Flushing Raynes to dwell in. The descendants of the House of Rayne composed the majority of its population. Most of the people of Asalia and Stallcroft was thus also descended from either the House of Rayne or those of their folk that never crossed the Blue Mountains.

## Vampiric Nature
The Flushing Raynes had a few vampires within the royal family. They had no interest in the vampiric forces in the north but were corrupt and sought to expand their influence. The family was 100% in support of Starfire during his great bluff about the New Nerathi Empire. The vampires especially enjoy seeing this come to pass as a way to influence Starfire. They are actually very weak and not in a position of great power. The Flushing Raynes planned to serve the heir loyally in return for the position of high counselor of Nerath.

## Downfall

### Discovery
The God's Chosen had foiled an assassination plot at the [Highmount Estate](./HighmountEstate.md). They found a stockpile of poison in the cellars and traced its source back to a forest north of the Flushing Raynes. There, they defeated an ancient black dragon - the presumed source of the poison. Shortly after, [Mikal Rayne](/Characters/MikalRayne.md) arrived with his bodyguards.

His attempt to fool the God's Chosen failed for one simple reason. [Baurus](/Characters/Baurus.md) wore the [Monocle of Truth](https://quest-for-starfire.obsidianportal.com/items/monocle-of-truth). He saw the vampiric nature and immediately connected the dots. He approached Mikal slowly, tossed a vile of poison towards him (as proof of what they'd discovered) but abruptly took his axe and smashed the poison against his face. Chaos ensued as the God's chosen quickly dispatched Mikal and his brutes.

They returned, informing the Cascades of the plot and true nature of the Flushing Raynes. The Cascades banded together and annihilated the family and most of its history. The lands were given to Matrius Highmount.
