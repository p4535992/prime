The city of Chalcis is home to 20,000 people, mainly humans, but at any given time there are near 30,000 people in the city. The city is a beacon for artists from all over the world. Poets, actors, singers and bards fill the amphitheaters on a nightly basis. Chalcis is also a destination for those that seek to acquire knowledge, especially from the Ancient Age, Elder Age and the Age or Nerath. While there is a hefty fee to gain access to the vaults, all parts of the archives are open to the public. This matches the beliefs of the citizens, in that “all peoples should be educated, in order to be a light in these dark times.” Simply said, Chalcis is a place of culture and of the arts.

While Chalcis might be a beacon of culture, they also excel in the art of military strategy. Young boys and girls are enlisted into academies where they are taught all arts and sciences as well as training to be in peak physical condition. When they turn 10, the youth of Chalcis get to pick a focus in their studies. Their academies produce most of the military elite that fill the ranks of the Imperial forces.

The city of Chalcis has a few landmarks that it is well known for. The [Theòs](../Locations/Theos.md) is a wonder and a relic left behind by the Nerathi. The [Théatro](../Locations/Theatro.md) is an amphitheater that is set against the coastline, welcoming thousands of guests every night. The Grand Archives house ancient texts and newer workings from some of the patrons that grace the city, it is open to the public. The House of Commons was an old governmental building used by the Nerathi for town hall meetings (or so the scholars believe), but it is now a market place that merchants from distant shores sell their wares.
