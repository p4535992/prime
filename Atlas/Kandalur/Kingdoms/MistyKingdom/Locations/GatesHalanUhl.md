These wondrous gates are spread across the Misty Kingdom as well as across Isle Dragor. Some say there are dozens and some believe there are thousands.

The Gates of Halan Uhl (translated as “Halan’s (Halandor’s) Shield”) act as portals for easy access between the two realms. They are considered one of the greatest creations of all time and a world wonder.
