The port resting south of Asalia was called both “Lady’s Love” and “Bahamut’s Grace” depending upon who you'd ask. Ages ago it was originally the residence of aquatic elves who practiced a very particular form of magic concerned with probabilities and luck. Through the generations the magic warped the area into a place where fortunes, both good and bad, are pushed to their extremes in the area. 

Recognizing the dangers of such an aberration the aquatic elves left the area. It did not take long for groups of greedy humans and half orcs to realize the potential wealth to be made by such a place. The region took on a deep propensity towards gambling, many casinos and other such “recreational” institutions were opened, and the port of “Lady’s Love” was born. 

A particularly fanatical cult of Bahamut then moved in and took it upon themselves to cleanse “Lady’s Love” of its vices. Moving into the area religious fanatics, some well-meaning good people, and all the sell swords this brand of Bahamut worship could purchase, occupied the city and drove out the casinos, brothels and other places that could be connected to vice. Many of the former gangsters moved their casinos onto gigantic barges just off the shore of “Lady’s Love”, newly renamed “Bahamut’s Grace” by the conquerors, as a symbol of defiance.
