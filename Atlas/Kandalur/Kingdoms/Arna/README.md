History concerning Arna…

Arna, which translates to The Mossflower in the common tongue, is a large beautifully forested woodland area on the River Moss. Arna is divided in two by the River Moss, which can be crossed by several bridges or at the crossroads at Summerdell. It lies just south of the Northlands where the Vryloka’s evil kin were banished to long ago, and to the west of [Asalia](../MistyKingdom/Settlements/Asalia.md). Aside from the treachery of Kale the Cruel, Arna remains a place of harmony. Trade is frequent with the neighboring lands, festivals and tournaments of the lance and sword are held frequently in the countryside and the annual Tournament of Fire is held outside Haran, the Capitol of Arna. Arna is home to many of the best craftsmen, farmers and builders. When Kale the Cruel led the army out of Eriador, the Vampires he had sworn a truce with invaded the city. A resistance was led by the Prince Lomian, the Vampires were crushed and Kale the Cruel brought to justice.
