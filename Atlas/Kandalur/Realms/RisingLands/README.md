## Resources

The lands here are not as fertile for farming yet a few regions provide a decent amount of corn, soybeans, and grains.

The seaside communities provide an overwhelming amount of fresh fish and seafood. Crab is not found in this region though. Swordfish, shark, and a variety of smaller fish are caught in masses on a daily basis.

The Cradled Coast is unique in that it provides bountiful resources of glass and gems.
