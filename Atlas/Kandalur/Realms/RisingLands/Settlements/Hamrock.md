### Defenses

The Hamrock Guard is only a few dozen strong. A small, stone wall surrounds most of the town.

### Commerce

Fish, farmed meats and grains, and some rare trades from incoming ships provide most of the commerce in town.

### Government

A small temple is one of the few remaining along the Cradled Coast. The priest provides most of the town’s direction, with prominent town council members carrying out the rules.

### Locations of Interest
#### White Shore Inn
Sitting on the waters of the Cradled Coast, this inn serves Fishermen, Shipwrights, Smugglers, Guides, Oarsmen, Crabbers. An oaken bar with large kegs lines the wall. Large tapestries hung around the inn depict symbols of the Temple Guardian faith, the Dawn War deities.

Shelves are lined with wooden models of sailing ships, in all sizes.

A scroll is framed above the bench inside the door. On it, reads:

> “When toil and trouble finds ye’ down
>
> And your head’s heavy from the crown
>
> When broken fists can’t make it right
>
> And you lie awake through the night
>
> A hoppy dose of ale will help
>
> As diverse as the colors of
>
> Ten drinks down all is well
>
> You find your brethren in the inn
>
> Where you spill your blood and gin
>
> You know the world can’t get you here
>
> For in the lodge you disappear
>
> O, just think of every tale
>
> That started with a pint of ale”

This scroll is a symbol. It means the famed Brewer’s Guild of Aer has been here and appointed this inn worthy of their seal.
