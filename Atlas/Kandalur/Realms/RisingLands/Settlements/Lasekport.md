> Special Note: The two new recruits Arias and Athnarl show true potential, as well as a third whose name I couldn’t learn. In the instance that they are victorious in the Games, a new rule shall come into effect that no first time entrants may be released even if they succeed in their first games. After the embarrassment of Mace and Rasp killing each other, effectively cutting our supply of useful gladiators, we need to keep as many alive as possible.
