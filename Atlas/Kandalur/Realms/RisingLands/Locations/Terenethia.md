## Introduction

An ancient, lost city of the elves, Terenethia now sits in silent splendor – a dark theater of glorious days past.

In a valley surrounded by mountains and the coast, white stone ruins tell of a city long forgotten. Only three sets of ruins even resemble structures.

## The Bath House

A small stone structure has no windows but openings lead around corners into a main room. In the middle, a large bath. Strangely, the water is still warm with steam rising.

## The Glass Spire

A very large tower of green glass rises into the blue sky. Inside, the green earth has taken over – leading to the *greenish* color seen from the outside. Balconies and staircases rise up throughout the spire, nearing the open top. A beautiful song can be heard.

## The Longhall

A stone structure with a large center room. A stone table reaches 30 feet across. A side room has a few books on a shelf. Only one has pages that haven’t faded.
