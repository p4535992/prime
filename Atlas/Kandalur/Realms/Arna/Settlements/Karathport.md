## History

- Founded by the Dragonborn, House of Medrazh in 10 A.N.
- Oldest city in Arna
- Built to fortify the mouth of the river from the ocean

## City Layout/Architecture

### Defenses

- Built with two forts on either side of the river, built on two hills. The forts are then joined by a fortified skywalk called the “brow of Bahamut”
- Between the two forts are two sets of chains, referred to as “Bahamut’s Teeth” In times of war, both chains are raised, blocking passage into the harbor
- Surrounding the city is a wall of pure Obsidian. It is said that the blocks of obsidian were melded together by Bahamut himself thus creating the smoothness of the walls.
- The river is lined with obsidian, causing erosion to be of no concern
