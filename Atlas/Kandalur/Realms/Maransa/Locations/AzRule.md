# Az'Rule

The ancient peaks of Az’Rule mark the very edges of the Maransan desert and the location of some of the most violent electric storms in the Fold. Ancient legend states that the dragon, Az’rul, faces off in a constant battle against Nakheten, the raging storm.

In recent years, these storms have all but ceased. Word is spreading that Az’Rul was defeated by the bravest warriors of Tristan Blackstone’s army.
