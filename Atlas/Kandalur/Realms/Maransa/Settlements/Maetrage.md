# Maetrage <!-- omit in toc -->

Maetrage is known by all in Maransa as the Jewel in the Sand. All outside Maransa know it as the Cursed City. It is the largest city in Maransa and some say in all of Kandalur. The city is filled with vile creatures, gamblers, prostitutes, murderers, and it is rumored that beneath the city lies a direct channel to the Underdark. Maetrage is also home to a group known as [The Rising Fall](/FactionsOrganizations/RisingFall.md).

### The Tower of Shan ‘Aman

The wizard’s guild in Maetrage.

### The Buka ’Ukan

This coliseum-like structure is circular in nature. The outer ring is an indoor market. The inner ring is outdoors and is the slave trade with another market. There is also a HUGE tavern known as the Hourglass. Everyone who is anyone hangs out here.

This marketplace is the largest slave trade in all Aestonia. Maransa is the only land where slavery is still socially accepted.

#### Hourglass

This massive tavern serves a more diverse group of people than most in the entire world. You can find some very interesting creatures having a drink here.

### The Deepening Stalls

This section of the city is a giant mine. Deep within, there are veins of precious Astia. The appearance is slightly run-down since mostly workers live here. As the mining projects progress further underground, the original structures become abandoned and broken. If one were to travel to the very deepest caverns, they would notice the structures get progressively nicer as they travel deeper. The current operator is Larg Axeforged. Very few slaves are used here as Larg believes them to be less skilled than the miners.
