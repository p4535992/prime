## Resources

This desert is not fertile for farming of any sort. Some mines in the area are said to hold gold but Maransaâ€™s largest export is [Astia](#Astia). It is found in great amounts all over Maransa and especially concentrated near the city of Maetrage.

### Astia

Astia is a substance found in only a few parts of the world. Maransa contains the largest deposits currently known. Astia is sand that has been magically infused with gold. Ancient scrolls speak of magical explosions caused by the very primordials themselves that created this rare substance. Astia can undergo processes to remove the valuable gold, the magic, or both from ores found deep within the world. The magic gathered is often used to enchant items or for aesthetic purposes in luxurious homes.
