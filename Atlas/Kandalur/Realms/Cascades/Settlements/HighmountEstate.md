Matrius Highmount founded the Highmount Estate in 191 AN. She brought her new wealth into the Cascades in secret and founded her estate which created a small following. With no immediate family to speak of, others wonder who populates the grand estate with Matrius. She has the least contact among the four families of the Cascades. They all equally despise her and her “new wealth” that they believe she stole in her past adventures.

Elves from the Realm of the Vines, as well as dwarves from the region inhabit the Highmount Estate. They come and go on a regular basis but only here do they get along to please Lady Matrius Highmount. She has done plenty to save both races from much tragedy throughout her adventures. Dwarves mine the mountains near the estate and elves help with other tasks and inhabit much of the housing.
