This amazing city is second in size only to Maetrage. This city however, reaches for the skies. Walkways, bridges, and even roads crisscross above the earth to create a wondrous sight. The lower regions of the city are the slums with the nobles living higher up in towers and skydomes. Skylast holds a great deal of power and is full of travelers from all over Kandalur.

### The Axtarium

The famed halls of the Axtarium are known all over Kandalur. It is here that the finest weapons, known to any, are forged. Races of all sorts can be found throughout the magnificent structure, forging weapons that will be put into books of history and wonder. This is no factory of weapons that shells out hundreds per day. The Axtarium may not see the completion of a single weapon for over a month at a time.

### Halls of Halandor

The wondrous Halls of Halandor contain beauty that most revere as other-worldly. Large windows encompass the many halls as bas-reliefs look upon visitors alongside marvelous paintings from the floor around the curved ceilings. Depictions of the history of the world stare upon those whose eyes should be caught in wonder. The halls are named after Harpam Halandor, the storied hero that defended Isle Dragor from the Ruler of Ruin’s armies.

The [Council at Skylast](#Council-at-Skylast) convenes in these magnificent halls.

### Sky Academy

Some would say that Sky Academy is the finest intellectual institution in the world. The rest, would have to agree. No school has an older heritage, such worldly (and other-worldly) instructors, or the resources available to compare. Eager and wealthy individuals from around the world try to learn to be the best at their given trade or the brightest in their field of study at Sky Academy.

### Water Guild

The Water Guild of Skylast manages all doings with water. They control the sewage system, the water supply, irrigation in and around the city, and all dealings at water-based docks. They hold a good deal of power within the city and know most of the secret passages and tunnels that run in and under the city.

### Sanctum of Mages

This strange structure hides something mysterious. The Sanctum of Mages holds one of the oldest and truest lines of wizardry in the known world.

Admittance into the Sanctum of Mages is rare. The Council has no control over this dominion of Skylast.

### Io’s Flame

Rare warriors from around the world get an invite to study at Io’s Flame. This school worships the dragon god, Io through worshipping Bahamut (and occasionally Tiamat). Warriors learn and study the art of the dragon and become world-renown fighters through their schooling. It is said that Harpam Halandor studied here.

Legend has it that Harpam is actually buried deep beneath this fortress, with Halandor’s Courage, a Vorpal sword he used to defeat the Ruler of Ruin.
