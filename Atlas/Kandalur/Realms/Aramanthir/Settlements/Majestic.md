*In the high hills to the north and east rests the Kingdom of Aramanthir. This kingdom plays host to descendants of both the Nerathi and Arkhosian Empires of old and protects one of the most beautiful cities in the world. At Worldâ€™s Morning, above the mists, Majestic glows radiantly with the new dawn and welcomes the first light to the world.*
