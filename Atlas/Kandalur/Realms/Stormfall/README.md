## Intro

Stormfall was founded when a group from Alheim set out to free the gnomes from dragon born slavery. Alheim condemned the action but the defectors eventually succeeded and with the help of the gnomes, built a new kingdom in the west.

This kingdom is ruled by a confederacy. Each city/town governs itself but contributes to the good of the kingdom. Many cities/towns were upstarts after they branched away from Alheim.

## Flora

The lush landscape of the Kingdom of Stormfall presents much of the flora of Kâ€™ndara Thaen and the Cradled Coast but has some of its own rare plantlife.
