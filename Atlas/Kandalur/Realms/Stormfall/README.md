# Stormfall

Stormfall was founded when a group from Alheim set out to free the gnomes from dragon born slavery. Alheim condemned the action but the defectors eventually succeeded and with the help of the gnomes, built a new kingdom in the west.

This kingdom is ruled by a confederacy. Each city/town governs itself but contributes to the good of the kingdom. Many cities/towns were upstarts after they branched away from Alheim.
