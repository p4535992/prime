## Intro

The Kingdom of Erethel is ruled by spellcasters. The Staff of the Mage rules. A red wizard, blue wizard, white wizard, green wizard, and black wizard have divided control over the lands.

## Flora

The natural border with Aramanthir and the coast along the Crystal Sea provides a rich environment for some of the worldâ€™s most unique plants. As a fairly new kingdom, not much of the plantlife has been documented.
