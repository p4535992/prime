## Intro

Far to the south, the hills give way to weak and barren trees. Only the bravest of travelers seeks out the rare yet powerful herbs and chemicals found in these vast swamps. Among the dangerous inhabitants are the Fallen Elves, a banished, sickly people. Though depending on the storyteller, they descend from the greatest hero of all.

## Flora

The swamps and marshes of Amystere are home to some of the rarest and strangest plantlife in all of Kandalur. The Fallen Elves are said to use it in all matter of potions and strange alchemy.
