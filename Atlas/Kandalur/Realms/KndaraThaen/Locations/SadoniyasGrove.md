# Sadoniya's Grove

Across the River Innocence, near Destiny’s Point, a small forest grows at the base of a small mountain. Deep within it, there is said to be a grove filled with magic and sorcery. Strangely, the children of the town say that this is where nightmares come from. More than one traveler along the Red Road has also heard and seen strange things across the river near this grove. Children speak of someone named Sadoniya. And so it was named Sadoniya’s Grove.
