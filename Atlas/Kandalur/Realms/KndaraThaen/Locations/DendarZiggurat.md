# The Dendar Ziggurat

Deep within the Forest of the Ancients, travelers have recently spoken of lights and sounds coming from a hidden ziggurat northeast of Destiny’s Point.

Yuan-ti have dedicated this ziggurat and their dark rituals to Dendar, the Night Serpent.

There is a letter that might be found on Yss’lk at the Black Rock Lookout. It was written by Tsa’kry asking her to get the bandits to feed to Dendar.
