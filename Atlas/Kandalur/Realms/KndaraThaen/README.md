## Intro

K’ndara Thaen is a mountainous and forested region filled with beauty. Flowing rivers, majestic waterfalls, and mysterious woods fill this kingdom in Kandalur. Nine elven tribes once ruled and inhabited K’ndara Thaen but those days have long since passed. Only three tribes remain, though the famous bardic song *The Eyes of Thaen* refers to another.

This region is a loose association of tribes but formally rules by gerontocracy and meritocracy. The most intelligent oversee the societies but a council of elders handles the day-to-day work of the government. Elder councils make decision for the realm and ultimately answer to the fey courts, the highest of which is the Court of Stars.

## Flora

The forests, rivers, and mountains of K’ndara Thaen have some of the richest plantlife in all of Kandalur. Rare and exotic plants found nowhere else can be found all along the Cradled Coast.
