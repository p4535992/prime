# Y'dora's Grove <!-- omit in toc -->

Hidden deep within the forests of K’ndara Thaen, Y’dora’s Grove rests as the magical retreat and home to the [Dream Tree](#Dream-Tree) where elves travel as a pilgrimage during their lifetime. Once every Wheel, the Summer Court meets here.

### Dream Tree

*The Dream Tree is a sacred “Pillar of Life” and font of power in Kandalur. The elves of K’ndara Thaen have always worshiped the tree and held it sacred.*

The Dream Tree is one of the remaining fonts of power or “Pillars of Life” in Kandalur. These great fonts still hold power from before the Dawn War. They are the remnants of a world long forgotten. Much of the magic of the elves and K’ndara Thaen comes from this very tree. It towers over 700 feet tall, hidden deep within Y’dora’s Grove.
