# Lysoria <!-- omit in toc -->

The village of Lysoria of the northern reaches of Kandalur houses are hardier people. Being so far North the people are extremely self-reliant, each villager typically capable of caring mostly for themselves and their families in their own capacity. Long has it been relatively unnoticed by the outlying powers in Kandalur, the people only leaving to trade goods, typically livestock and hardy grains due to the tougher climate and isolation. This isolation is really what led to the self-reliant culture born in Lysoria. Frequent attacks by bandits early in their history made the people learn to fight and kill if need be to protect their homes. Lysoria has long maintained it’s own reputable militia that conscripts young men and women early in their teens to learn how to defend the village.

However, the people of Lysoria have recently been subjected to the will of the tyrant lord, [Fel Kraggen](/Characters/FelKraggen.md), extending his reach over the northern region of the Misty Kingdom. The people, not knowing much of being ruled by anyone but themselves have, very begrudgingly, accepted the “protection” of this lord. Though his subjugation and exploitation of what little the Lysorians have has led to a gradually heating conflict between them.
