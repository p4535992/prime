The Misty Kingdom was once a beautiful, proud and glorious kingdom. Now, it lay in warped ruins. Many of the cities have been destroyed and a strange magic has warped the land as dangerous creatures moved in.

## Downfall

After the mind flayer attack in 207 AN, the Misty Kingdom was weak. After the Great Silencing, there was an even greater unrest in the kingdom. [Yahlrisik-Ul](../../../../Characters/YahlrisikUl.md) advanced in the chaos, returning and creating a kingdom of slaves, ever-growing.

## Resources

The Hedrol Mountains provide ore deposits of copper and iron. Some claim that gold deposits can be found in the far northern regions.
The seaside communities provide a good deal of fish and crab as well as pearls in the northern region.

The Misty Kingdom can be cooler yet still provides fertile farmland. Rich in berries and fruits, the Misty Kingdom also grows a good deal of greens and grains.
