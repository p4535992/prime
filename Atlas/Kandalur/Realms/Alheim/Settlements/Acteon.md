# Acteon

Acteon is the pinnacle of Imperial Alheim’s naval capabilities. The drydocks located here are now turning out more than 5 ships a year. With elite training, this naval base protects Alheim’s oceans from all threats, allowing the other military branches to focus on reclaiming land from despots and warlords. The base is home to 10,000 marines and sailors, with thousands at a time on current duty.
