*Lighthouse of Alexandria from Assassin's Creed Origins.*

A symbol of Old Nerath’s power and reach, the lighthouse has stood for over 1,000 years. It’s light illuminates the coastlines of the Five Kings through some sort of magic, creating an effect of twilight that lasts all night. Scholars, wizards and men of science have tried to explain the light’s power for centuries, but beyond knowing that it is magical, they have not been able to explain the light.
