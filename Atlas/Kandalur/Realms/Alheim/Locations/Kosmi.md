Kosmi is home to two ports. The first [Acteon](../Settlements/Acteon.md), a military port, lies at the northern most point of the island. The second is [Chalcis](../Settlements/Chalcis.md), a town rebuilt upon Nerathi ruins on the southwestern coast. The coastline of Kosmi is very rocky with only a few palm trees jutting out from atop crags and ledges. There are very few native animals to the island; besides a few large species of birds, there are only small reptiles and rodents that call the island their home.

Outside of the ports, Kosmi is covered in gently rolling hills with very few trees. Olives are grown here, the finest in all of Kandalur. The olives are used for pickling and to make oil, the wares are then shipped all over the world. The city of Chalcis owns the plantations, the warehouses in which the olives and canned, and the facilities necessary to turn it into the oil. All profits from the sales go directly back into the cities infrastructure; this keeps taxes low and allows the citizens of Chalcis to keep all of their wages. This structure has allowed Chalcis to grow into a beautiful and prospering community.

On a bluff in the middle of the island, sits the Theòs. A symbol of Old Nerath’s power and reach, the lighthouse has stood for over 1,000 years. It’s light illuminates the coastlines of the Five Kings through some sort of magic, creating an effect of twilight that lasts all night. Scholars, wizards and men of science have tried to explain the light’s power for centuries, but beyond knowing that it is magical, they have not been able to explain the light.

When the alliances between dwarves and men were reignited, the city of Chalcis hired a team of dwarven master stonemen and Scholora to rebuild the ruins of old Kosmi. Bringing the city of Chalcis and the Acteon Harbor back to its old glory, as in the days of the Nerathi. Kosmi is truly a jewel in the relatively new Imperial Alheim.
