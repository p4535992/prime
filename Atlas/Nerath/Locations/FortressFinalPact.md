Not much is known about the Fortress of the Final Pact, apart from how it got its name: near the end of the war between the Tiefling and Dragonborn Empires, a mighty Tiefling warlock took it upon himself to make a deal with great shadowy forces from beyond, in the hopes of securing enough power to deal the ultimate blow to what he considered “the reptilian razzle which seeks to usurp our well-deserved power from us.”

Although no one knows exactly what happened, it is plain to see that the deal didn’t work as planned. The land around the once-mighty fortress is now nothing but blackened rocky desolation. Despite the destruction, however, it is rumoured that many items of power still reside inside the ruins. Along with some horrible creatures, no doubt…
