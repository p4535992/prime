## Occupation and History

He likes sharp things. He loves to make people bleed, so he keeps trying to figure our new ways to do so. He also skins his victims, because it gives him the same pleasure as a more normal person might get from peeling paint off a wall.

He doesn't feel pain normally except through a long sheering poke from something sharp. It's almost pleasant to him because it allows him to feel something. This neurological disability gave him a stigma for being cursed or considered mentally challenged at a young age; he was a noble's son and fell into a fire without noticing. They stripped him of any duties and most authority in anything but title.

He takes on the precedence of being a warlord and will gladly injure himself in combat in order to make finishing blows (since he doesn't flinch like others); trying to prove his disability is an advantage not a retardation. He has to have a team of personal healers and doctors to keep him alive from all the injuries he hurls himself into.

He has a motivation that is human (proving one's worth), an infinite resource that makes him mysterious (coming back from horrible injuries and utter infinite relentlessness), and a weakness (his time of recovery).
