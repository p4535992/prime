## History

Barakas who became Dread.

After the war, Barakas renounced the Rising Fall, an evil faction that he helped create. He was ready to forgive humanity after meeting the love of his life, Nikal Alera. The two restored an abandoned keep and lived in peace for years. 

One night, King Blackstone's assassins broke in. They sought out the last remaining leader of the Rising Fall, whom they thought to be Barakas. 

Left for dead, Barakas awoke days later. Nikal was gone. Their home, torn apart. For days, he wept. Then came anger. Hatred. 

Barakas forgot his birth-name, becoming Dread. He resurrected the Rising Fall and has vowed to end King Blackstone's reign.
