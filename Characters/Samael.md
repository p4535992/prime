## Introduction

## Notes

### Campaign Notes

Samael was an elder green dragon. His home was always in the [Realm of the Vines](/Atlas/Kandalur/Realms/RealmOfTheVines/README.md) with the close ties to the [Feywild](/Atlas/Feywild/README.md) never far away. With the growing unrest in Aestonia however, he set out on traveling and striking deals with powerful beings. His deals always had a great benefit for himself, often unseen by the other dealer. Being an elder dragon, Samael was a dangerous being both in negotiations and combat. He had been around for hundreds of years.

Samael was unbelievably powerful. Purely evil however, he will never engage in negotiations with those of a different alignment.

Though dealt his "death" at the hands of [Argarwane](/Characters/Argarwane.md), he is actually still alive.
