Lukrus Rayne held a tremendous amount of wealth. The [Flushing Raynes](../Atlas/Kandalur/Kingdoms/Cascades/Settlements/FlushingRaynes.md) were a prominent house with a prominent military force.

Lukrus was a vampire with a raging temper that had actually hurt his status in the [Cascades](../Atlas/Kandalur/Kingdoms/Cascades/README.md). Once a growing estate, many blamed his ‘descent into madness’ for its decline.

Lukrus dabbled in sorcery and summons. He escaped the attack on his house and went to the imperial city of Nerath. He sat atop the old tower guard creating his final summons. He hoped to control the Balor to destroy his enemies. He did not know that he could not control it.

The Balor quickly killed Lukrus, before being destroyed by the God's Chosen in a battle of epic proportions.
