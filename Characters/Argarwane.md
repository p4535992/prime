## Introduction
## Notes
### Campaign Notes
## Occupation and History
Argarwane was a human from the kingdom of Algoria. His memory left him but he discovered his royal bloodline to the Algorian throne. Little else was known about him…
### Transformation into Lord Argaroth
Argarwane flew for days on the back of Samael before crashing into a site of ancient ruins. Samael convinced him that he was abandoned and would die alone before the dragon died of its wounds. Argarwane found Samael’s gem necklace which let him heavily influence individuals, even dragons. After defeating certain dragons in the area and talking with others, Argarwane began to grow angry in his isolation. He was abandoned.

Samael had performed a dark ritual during his conversation with Argarwane. This ritual imbued him as Argaroth, Dragon Lord. His thirst for revenge would grow. Three, Shadow, Aetius, & Lomian would pay. But first, he would find Gauthak, the soldier who abandoned his post, leaving Algoria destroyed. Revenge would be his…

After a fierce battle with Gauthak, Lord Argaroth was defeated and the dragon spirit left his body. The God's Chosen used the greatest healers in the Astral Sea to slowly recover their friend, Argarwane.
