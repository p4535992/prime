## Occupation and History

The tyrant’s name is Fel Kraggen, an aspiring lord from south of Lysoria. Growing up in a very rich family, Fel knew little of a life without luxury and power. When he came into possession of his family’s legacy he looked upon it with disappointment at how little they controlled with the amount of money they wielded, and took it upon himself to buy out private armies of mercenaries and bandits to begin pushing his way into the free reaches of the North.

Lysoria was one of many small freelands to be absorbed, but has been a large point of contention as of late. After the 20 year rule, Fel has done nothing more than tighten his grip into a stranglehold over the northern reaches in order to drain the land of funds to follow some sort of secret agenda. When the tyrant surveys his territories some people speak of horrid sounds in the night coming from his holds.

Lysoria’s people, being less daunted than others, have begun plans for a revolt and are seeking help from those willing to destroy tyrants (despite having little to reward) after discovering many of the tyrants occupying militia, beneath their expensive and shining new armor, are the same devil-worshipping bandit groups that have plagued their village for generations.
