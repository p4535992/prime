## Occupation and History
Vengeance was once the leader of a great Tiefling army in his land. After he had decided to settle down with his family (his wife Hope, and son Perserverance), he was betrayed by a friend and ally of the Dragonborne race. The Dragonborne slew his family and went into hiding. Once Vengeance had discovered this, he went on a blood hunt for the Dragonborne. He found the traitor, and punished him accordingly. Framed for the murder of his family, and found at the scene of the crime he had committed, he was sentenced to life in prison. One fateful night however, Vengeance escaped and came upon two travelers, seeking shelter from a stormâ€¦

Sometime later, Vengeance was overcome with sickness from a poisonous attack. [Chigaru](/Characters/Chigaru.md) sacrificed himself in a ritual to save him. But Vengeance could only be saved by his soul moving to a body he despised: a dragonborn.
