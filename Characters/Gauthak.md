### Campaign Notes

As a child I was from the Dawnforge Mountains in a village called Quakalest. My mother died giving birth to me and my father died 8 years later in battle. As an orphan I was sent to the stronghold of Stoneridge to be trained to become a warrior. As the years went on and battles fought, I learned quickly and became a fierce warrior and became the best Giant Warrior they had seen in many years. I have lead many armies into battle and have never lost a fight. At the age of 21 I decided that I grew tired of living the life of a warrior at the stronghold and decided to be released from service and go off on my own to find who I really am. I happened to be in Hammerfast during my travel across the land of the Nentir Vale, when I was approached by a party who were gathering warriors to fight an unknown evil. I gladly volunteered because of my military experience and skill in fighting.
