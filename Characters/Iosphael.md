According to scholars, Starfire and the God's Chosen annihilated Iosphael with Starfire's Gaze. Some say this was the cause of the Starfire Calamity.

## Introduction

### Campaign Notes

## Occupation and History

This creature has long lived apart from the mortal world and traversed among the stars. When Io was split and Bahamut & Tiamat were born the new dragon gods, a certain essence of Io escaped into the stars and became Iosphael. This aspect of Io represented raw power and a child-like wonder deep within. The stars respect him as a supreme ruler among them. It is the flicker of his tail across the face of a star that creates the blinking effect many attribute to the night sky.

Iosphael had been separated from the world since Io flew among the gods. Starfireâ€™s Gaze was stealing power from the stars and thusly infuriating Iosphael. Should he venture to the mortal world, it would have been worldbreaking indeed. Starfire knew that.
