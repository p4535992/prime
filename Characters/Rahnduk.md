# Rahnduk
## The Orc Warlord
Rahnduk is the overlord of the Broken Stone tribe in Kandalur. He despises Gruumsh, which makes him a target among other orc tribes yet everyone has failed to bring him down. He is searching for a dark ritual that will infuse him with demonic powers and has vowed to "set the west on fire."
