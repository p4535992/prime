## Death

## Introduction

In the early days after the death of Haramathur, as his gospel was spread amongst the denizens of the Astral Sea a temple was erected in his honor. Though a noble and benevolent order of priests inhabited this temple, they needed a stalwart guardian of their order. From that need was born One, Haramathurâ€™s Justice, the first of his Chosen 4. Along with his creation One was made a mace to guard the weak which was named Brightfist, and a brightly polished shield bearing the likeness of a man divided down the middle one half black and one half white to symbolize the living and dead nature of his deity. As is the nature of his order, One has removed a sizeable part of the haft of his mace, choosing to use his holy symbol as a hilt so that Brightfist may only be used to uphold the justice for which he stands.
