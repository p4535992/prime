## Introduction

## Notes

### Campaign Notes

Baurus found his people, scattered after they'd abandoned Minora. He rallied them and led an expidition into Alheim and the famed dwarvish halls of his ancestors. After years of no contact, the Halls of Hammerdawn opened their doors. King Baurus had arrived.

He struck a deal with the Emperor of Alheim and is now an ally of the Empire of Alheim.

#### Quest for Starfire Campaign Notes

Baurus comes from the dwarven mountains in the Misty Kingdom. He prefers treasure-hunting to anything else but has aligned with the adventuring party quite nicely and is curious about this [Starfire](/Characters/Starfire.md) character.

Baurus now knows what happened to Minora. The city was abandoned after a struggle with the drow. It is his belief that the drow came in search of Ashkahir Faeldaroch. He is unsure if their search was successful. He was unable to track his friends’ whereabouts as well.

Since, Baurus has been tracking a new threat. While traversing the Astral Sea, his ship encountered a strange phenomenon and crash-landed on Ashfilar, the Land of 1000 Spires. Baurus remembers a great, golden light in the night sky followed by a tearing sound. As it appeared space was being torn before him, a monstrous ship appeared through the tear and attacked his own. Once crash-landed, Baurus identified the threat as mind-flayers which had somehow crossed from the Far Realm. He slaughtered the weaklings he found on Ashfilar. He knew that this incursion into the world and its planes of existence would heighten the activity of such mind-flayers deep in the Underdark. Unfortunately, he knew exactly where they’d strike first. Baurus set off for the Misty Kingdom immediately.

## Occupation and History

Baurus hails from the Dwarven city of Minora just south of the Misty Kingdom. He is a friend of [Chigaru](/Characters/Chigaru.md) and came at his initial request, though he stayed with the party long after Chigaru’s death.

In his early life Baurus was the son of a rich family of artifact collectors and craftsmen in the city of Minora. However an item of great importance to the dwarven city that also served as a family heirloom to Baurus’ family was stolen and assumed to be lost. Shamed in his community, his father was ostracized until his death. Upon that day Baurus took up the mantle of a treasure hunter and swore on the grave of his father that he would return to the city one day with his family’s axe and return them to their former glory.

Baurus retrieved the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. While traveling through Minora after its abandonment, Baurus visited his old home. He placed the axe on its mantle above the fireplace, fulfilling his promise and restoring his family's good name. Shortly after, the city was destroyed. He still carries the axe with him to this day.

This item allows the wearer to see the true form of beings. It can see right through shapeshifters and their tricks.

The monocle belonged to Argid Madrithin. His daughter inherited it and was rumored to have been locked in the Tower of Waiting due to her malicious acts around Fallcrest. She has never been seen again.

### Moradin's Voice

Throughout the ages many have wondered how the impressive vaults of the mountain city of Minora were carved. Though average dwarves boast that it was through the sweat and blood of their ancestors that these halls were carved, it was actually all thanks to one flute. Though lost to a sudden attack by drow, it was the ancestors of Morlan Thunderbeard who were once the owners of the flute.

It is said that Thunderbeard’s claim to fame was his booming voice that shook the very stone around him when he sang. These seemingly exaggerated tales actually speak a great truth, however the whole of which has been lost to time. Thunderbeard did, in fact, shake, shape, and mold the stone of Minora’s halls with the use of Moradin’s voice, for that is what none remember; it’s power.

Created by Moradin and gifted to his people, the flute holds mastery over stone for they who can play it. A simple tune on the flute, followed by a command can see stone walls split, statues carved in moments, or anything that the player can dream.

Thankfully to any but the descendants of Morlan Thunderbeard it is a simple stone flute. Woe unto the world of man if the Voice were able to be used by any other…
