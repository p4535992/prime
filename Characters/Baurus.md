## Background

Baurus hails from the Dwarven city of Minora just south of the Misty Kingdom. He is a friend of [Chigaru](/Characters/Chigaru.md) and came at his initial request, though he stayed with the party long after Chigaru’s death.

In his early life Baurus was the son of a rich family of artifact collectors and craftsmen in the city of Minora. However an item of great importance to the dwarven city that also served as a family heirloom to Baurus’ family was stolen and assumed to be lost. Shamed in his community, his father was ostracized until his death. Upon that day Baurus took up the mantle of a treasure hunter and swore on the grave of his father that he would return to the city one day with his family’s axe and return them to their former glory.

Baurus retrieved the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords. While traveling through Minora after its abandonment, Baurus visited his old home. He placed the axe on its mantle above the fireplace, fulfilling his promise and restoring his family's good name. Shortly after, the city was destroyed. He still carries the axe with him to this day.

## Current Campaign Notes

Baurus found his people, scattered after they'd abandoned Minora. He rallied them and led an expidition into Alheim and the famed dwarvish halls of his ancestors. After years of no contact, the Halls of Hammerdawn opened their doors. King Baurus had arrived.

He struck a deal with the Emperor of Alheim and is now an ally of the Empire of Alheim.

## Past Campaign Notes

Baurus comes from the dwarven mountains in the Misty Kingdom. He prefers treasure-hunting to anything else but has aligned with the adventuring party quite nicely and is curious about this [Starfire](/Characters/Starfire.md) character.

Baurus now knows what happened to Minora. The city was abandoned after a struggle with the drow. It is his belief that the drow came in search of Ashkahir Faeldaroch. He is unsure if their search was successful. He was unable to track his friends’ whereabouts as well.

Since, Baurus has been tracking a new threat. While traversing the Astral Sea, his ship encountered a strange phenomenon and crash-landed on Ashfilar, the Land of 1000 Spires. Baurus remembers a great, golden light in the night sky followed by a tearing sound. As it appeared space was being torn before him, a monstrous ship appeared through the tear and attacked his own. Once crash-landed, Baurus identified the threat as mind-flayers which had somehow crossed from the Far Realm. He slaughtered the weaklings he found on Ashfilar. He knew that this incursion into the world and its planes of existence would heighten the activity of such mind-flayers deep in the Underdark. Unfortunately, he knew exactly where they’d strike first. Baurus set off for the Misty Kingdom immediately.
