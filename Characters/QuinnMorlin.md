Quinn's prime talent was disguise and taking on different personalities. Here are his two other personas from the Quest for Starfire campaign:

#### Jaerys Foxstone

Jaerys Foxstone was the most famous adventurer in the Nentir Vale. He resided in Nenlast, a trading community. He acquired valuable items on his quests and brought them back to keep up the trade.

#### Truck Russeln

Little of Truck was known to others except his specific skill set in remaining hidden and getting jobs done.

He left New Haven close to 9 months before its destruction and travelled north to the Cascades to learn the whereabouts of his friends. He left New Haven with the soldiers of Arna in charge.

Truck would not expose his true identity. He kept it hidden even when he found his friends. He “let Quinn die with New Haven” when he heard the news.

He became a master trader for the God's Chosen, traveling the Astral Sea and making incredible amounts of money. He acquired many items they needed with ease.

## Talent

Quinn Morlin was still very much into adventuring. He was seen by most as too old but he loved it all just the same. He was quick-witted and not to be outsmarted. His techniques in stealth and dungeoneering were impeccable.
