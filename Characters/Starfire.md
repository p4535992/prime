## Death

## Introduction

Sotanax was the primary antagonist of the major arc in the Quest for Starfire's Gaze campaign.

## Notes

### Campaign Notes

Starfire has created a mystical artifact known as Starfire’s Gaze. Not much is known about it at this point but it is rumored that it can concentrate the power of the stars in the Far Realm. This power could be used in war or in times of peace. It can destroy its enemies or see into the future and past.

Starfire knows Nikal Allera is tracking him. He is also somewhat aware of the PCs. He has dispatched the Starseekers as of late.

Starfire is NOT the heir to the Nerathi Empire. He planted that idea based on some old translations of tomes regarding the Empire that he found in Brightkeep. He has certain scholars speaking of “Starfire” and how he is the heir to the Nerathi Empire. This is just his plan to keep the focus in the world and away from Hestavar. Starfall is also a distraction.

Starfire is fully aware of the war and its goings-on. He is also aware of Iosphael. He must continue his work to protect the world from the wrath of the star dragon.

The “Starfire” in Nerath is actually a warforged construct of Erathis. An illusion spell makes it look like a real person.

Starfire is essentially David Xanatos mixed with the Dread Pirate Roberts. He became the “Dread Pirate Roberts” which uses the name Starfire after his predecessor (Oaklord) retired.

Starfire is the name given to the chosen one who will carry out the task of creating the Eye of Time. This artifact is one of the most complex of Erathis’s Game of Making. Heroes have been attempting to stop Starfire for hundreds of years.
