## Flaw or Secret

His respect for honor has earned him his deepest, darkest secret. One hundred years ago, his guard brought in an old human who was found stealing apples from the marketplace.

“Have you no honor?” the leader spoke.

“Believe me, your mighty, I know honor in ways that you never could,” said the old man.

“Hold your tongue, old man. Maybe you can find some of that honor in the cold dungeons beneath the Prime.” He then sent the old man to rot in the cold, dark dungeons beneath the fortress.

Three days later, Kriv was called to the old man’s cell by some of his guards. The old man was gone and all that remained were a few canary feathers. Kriv realized his fault and filled with shame and guilt. Every day since, he has looked for opportunities to right the wrongs of his past.
