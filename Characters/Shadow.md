#### Quest for Starfire Original Notes

For the past 10 years, Shadow has been the personal body guard of Kord. Trained from a young age, the original home and name of Shadow is unknown. When Kord’s generals trained Shadow they removed all connections he had with his past and started anew. Shadow is a war machine, built to protect his god and fight till his last breath. He is not without fault though. For the past two or three years, Shadow has begun asking questions about his past, however, no one in the heavens will answer his questions.

When Kord asked Shadow to return to the realm of the world, he could not refuse. To serve one’s god directly is the highest of honors. Shadow had proven himself in the wars between Kord and Incabulos by single handedly pushing back the advances of Incabulos. Some would say Kord thinks of Shadow as a son that never was.

Blessed by Kord, Shadow returned to the realm of mortals. When Starfire decided to harness a power that could rival the gods, Shadow was Kord’s most devastating weapon to stop him. Also, Shadow may be able to find something out about his past, for he does not remember anything from the age of 10 to his birth. His parents and siblings are a mystery, as well as his homeland. This quest may help in more ways than just aiding his god.

When arriving to the realm of mortals, Kord had restrained some of Shadow’s power. Shadow must not draw too much attention to himself or his party. While Shadow proved himself during war, Kord was still eager to see what he was capable of. Restraining his powers so that he may have a small challenge will test Shadow’s ability to adapt to situations, making him an even more formittable opponent.

On the realm of mortals, Shadow was greeted by the party of Thalian, Three, and Argawane. Three great warriors that the world had to offer. Finding this to be a suitable party, Shadow ventured off. Argawane was found to be a king, and split from the party to rule his kingdom. The remaining three dove deep into the Tomb of Horrors (a place known for nothing but death and destruction) hoping to find answers to the wear-abouts of Starfire. While in the tomb, Shadow developed a bond and friendship with his fellow companions. Finding common ground with the two. Though Three worships Haramathore, Shadow found it to be honorable that he was serving his god directly, a similar task given to Shadow. Thalian was also a follower of Kord, in which Shadow found most welcoming. The three came across a thief named Quinn, who was later revealed to be nothing more than a fellow adventurer, searching for more thrills, being as he was nearly 50 years old and had not been on an adventure in some time. The party welcomed Quinn with open arms and went along. The three were now four, and the four became known as The Gods’ Chosen.

However, while in the tomb, the life of Thalian was taken from the party. Devastated, Shadow said his prayers and sent Thalian off on a fairy, which was then ignited by a flame cast by Shadow’s crossbow. Attached to the bolt fired, was the ring that was on Thalian’s finger, a ring that matched Shadow’s ring of Kord.

##### Post-Campaign Notes

You roam Sigil for weeks. The city is massive. Finally, walking thru a market one day, an old woman approaches you, “Yarehl?”

She motions you into a nearby home. The ceilings are low and the home is fairly dark. But the windows provide enough light that no candles are needed. She sits across the table from you and once again, she looks like the young fortune teller.

>“Yarehl, what is it you seek?”

Direction, choices. I need to see my options so that I may know which path to take.

“A choice you have made. Clearly, you seek something more than serving in the courts of your god. For you are here. Not there.”

“I did not know if you were chosen by Kord to lead me somewhere more. If I do not turn back for the gates, what is it that you would have of me?”

“I follow no god. I can show you truths that they would deny. But you would never be the same. Knowing these, you would never become the Dawn Warrior.”

“And what of Rikka? The Chosen? The Citadel? My friends? Would this path lead me from all that?”

“They do not rest along this path. You can choose to follow me or you can become the Dawn Warrior and keep your friends. It’s a choice that only you can make.”

“Then I must bid you farewell. Maybe another will follow your path.” 
Shadow stands up, nods, and leaves.

Shadow ascends the steps of the Dawn Palace on Celestia. Each step taken, representative of the years of his journey.

Inside the palace, the Messenger receives you. “Welcome, Warrior of the Dawn!” On that last word, he shouts and in an explosion of light, your armor ignites in flames. You see a beam of radiant light cast down before you. From above, a sword descends the funnel of light. As it comes to rest in your hands, the flames die out.

You now wear the Dawn Warrior armor and wield the Dawn Warrior’s Blade, both blessed by Kord himself.

“You’ve proven yourself and saved these worlds from utter destruction but at a cost. We now have even more fearsome battles to fight. In the darkness, the chains have been broken.”

“What do you ask of me?”

“The Starfire Calamity has greater consequences than we know. The world will be thrust into a darkness now like never before. It’s only beginning.

You must go to the world. Appear as nothing more than a mortal. There is a priest – a Brother Alphas Gladerion. Under cover of darkness, kill him. Prevent the next piece of this grand puzzle from falling.

Once you’ve done this, do not return to the Dawn Palace but instead return to your true love. Live out your life. Kord will call upon you when you are needed again."

As you command

Sir, I must ask before I leave. I have done all you requested, shall I lead your armies in the future? What is my full purpose for you? I suppose I am still confused

“Our armies are no match for what is to come. Enjoy that which you haven’t been able to…your life. When it is time for the Dawn Warrior to rise, maybe for the last time, you will be called.”

You don the clothes of a simple mortal, hiding who you really are. You travel to the world and a place known as the Dawn Sanctuary:

In the dark of night, you easily descend through an open window on one of the top floors. You move quietly down the marble hallway, beams of moonlight bathing the floor from each window.

You enter the quarters at the end of the hallway. A priest is kneeling in prayer, strange runes inscribed on the floor around him. You know this is Brother Alphas Gladerion.

You summon and raise the Dawn Warrior’s blade high above your head. He looks up slowly, meeting your eyes. Do you say anything? What do you do?

“Why would my god wish you dead?”

“I do not know you or your god. Am I to die, tonight?”

“For what reason would one want you dead? What have you done that the afterlife calls you so urgently?”

“There are deeper truths that we are only just discovering. I merely serve the people. Nothing more. They need protection now more than ever. Against men and gods. If you are to strike me down for that, so be it. I’m ready to go.”

“This is not the first I have heard of these truths. Please, what do you speak of?

His eyes glaze over momentarily. The color leaves them. Only dark orbs remain.

He smiles and very slowly starts to stand. He begins reciting something. “We are the keepers – the lore forbidden. Darkness eternal, chains now broken.” As he rises, his chanting gets louder. “We are the keepers – the lore forbidden! Darkness eternal, chains now broken!”

Almost fully standing now, he is shouting. “WE ARE THE KEEPERS – THE LORE FORBIDDEN. DARKNESS ETERNAL, CHAINS NOW BROKEN!” Midway through his recitation, he reaches into his cloak and pulls a knife. What do you do?

Shadow quickly brings his sword down on the man’s wrist as he pulls out the knife. “What are you?”

His eyes return to normal. A slight look of fear comes over him. “I am Brother Alphas Gladerion. Protector of the people.”

“I am sorry, Brother.” Shadow ignites his blade and slashes it across gladerion’s chest. Then sheathes his blade.

The priest falls and breathes no more. His remains lie in the circle of runes, no longer alight. The room is dark and cold. Completely silent. There is nothing more here.

You return at long last to New Haven, the settlement rebuilt by the God’s Chosen. Ricka Aldarion greets you and invites you into your new worldly home.

For 11 years, you enjoy peace with Ricka. During the eleventh year, you receive a message. “The last piece has fallen. Now begins the rise of the Dawn Warrior.” Without hesitation, you know where you must go. Though you do not expect to return.

At the gates of New Haven is an army like no other, stretching across the hills for miles. All are emblazoned with the symbols and blessings of Kord. The Messenger waits with them. “Dawn Warrior, are you ready to lead us into the black? Our fate awaits us in the Abyss.”
Before I go, I wish enough time to do one thing
As you wish

Shadow’s intent is one more night with Ricka. So he may ensure that his bloodline continue.

Before he sets out and leaves his family behind. He leaves a message with Ricka, asking her to raise our eventual child. Also, he leaves instructions to contact Three, Baurus, Vengeance, and Chigaru to inform them of where he is to depart to.
