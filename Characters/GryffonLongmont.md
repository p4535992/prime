## Description
Gryff is deeply tanned with no hair. He is of medium height with an athletic frame. He wears dark colors and has blackened all of his gear so as to increase his ability to hide from view.

Gryffon Longmont has retired from the adventuring life. Yes, he still goes on the occasional walkabout but for the most part his life is much quieter now. He has settled in Cyrl with his wife Addylyn. He owns a considerable amount of land and spends his days riding his Griffons or relaxing on the lawn. He still trains with the sword and bow just in case any of his old friends should come calling.
