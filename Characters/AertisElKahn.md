#### Quest for Starfire Notes

During his hunt for the God's Chosen, Aertis's gith pirate ship was sent into another dimension by [Silmarien](./Silmarien.md). He wasn't seen again during that campaign.

## Occupation and History

Aertis grew up in the matriarchal society of the drow. His skills and cunning led him to be used by his family for their benefit of gaining power within the society. The more he killed, the better he got at it. At last, he was able to assassinate his own mother (toppling the power they held in the city) and escape. He ended up far away and joined the Assassinâ€™s Guild in Maetrage. He is truly evil and follows the code of the assassins.

Aertis denounced Lolth and proclaimed to be a follower of Tiamat. The truth is, the only encounter that nearly cost the drow his life was at the hands of an elder red dragon. His one true fear is the presence of dragons.

Aertis now commands a group of mercenaries that prey on Imperial ships. He's looking for something. Rumors call him the Red Seer.
