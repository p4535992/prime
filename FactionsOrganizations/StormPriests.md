# Storm Priests <!-- omit in toc -->

The Storm Priests are a religious organization worshiping Kord, the storm god and lord of battle. They pray to him for good weather along the Red Road Trade and also pray for courage out in this dangerous wilderness.

The Storm Priests are comprised of priests, clerics, and even paladins that worship Kord. In the temple of the Storm Spire, there are many small shrines to other deities but they all lead to the largest, which is a sword with a lightning bolt hilt, displayed on a grand stand.

Storm Priests can appeal to Kord for good weather as they know the rituals and rites that he requires. They charge a small fee to do so.
