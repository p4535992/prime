The Kasaldabon is an extremely powerful crystal shard that is located somewhere in the southern half of The Fold. Though it looks like just an average shard of blue crystal, it is actually a petrified heart of a Deva. The Deva it is said to have belonged to traveled throughout The Fold for thousands of years. The Deva never died from wounds or being felled in battle. This particular Deva was very knowledgeable of the world, spending all of his time reading and exploring. He is said to have been the wisest being (besides the gods) to have ever lived.

One day while exploring The Fold an army happened upon him and tortured him to try and get him to spill information about an opposing army in the north. The Deva would not speak of the matter, so the general from the army carved out his heart. They put the heart in a bag of holding and carried it into battle. With the heart, the general felt like he had received some sort of “Blessing from the gods.” But the truth is, with the heart near, his intelligence of battle strategy had improved. The heart gave off an aura of different types of intelligence that had been studied by the Deva. Once the general returned home, he locked the heart away.

One night, a group of thieves sneaked into his home and stole his fortune, but when they left, decided to burn down the house…with the heart locked inside of it. The heart crystalized and was left in the wreckage. When cleaning up the wreck, the heart was tossed aside, mistaken for a decorative item. It hasn’t been seen since. It is said that one can hold the heart up to their own, and absorb the crystal and gain permanent knowledge of all the Deva knew…
