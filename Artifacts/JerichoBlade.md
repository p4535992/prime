## History

Jericho (Redynvar) of the Storm forged this blade in dragonfire during the Ancient Ages believing it would grant him the power to bring down the dragon Kraldraeg-Tanulth. The powerful sorcerer Mythil tried to stop Jericho to earn favor with the dragon but fell in battle to Jericho. The blade pierced his heart as he cast his final spell, absorbing the magic that flowed through the sorcerer. Jericho went on to defeat the dragon, whose magic was hindered by the blade.

## Abilities

The wielder of this blade resists all magical damage and has advantage against all creatures that have cast a spell during that encounter.

### Power

This weapon can interfere with a magic-userâ€™s spellcasting ability causing them to have to re-roll a spell attack or allowing the target of a spell to re-roll a save. This power cannot be summoned again until after a long rest.
