Nearly 2,500 years ago, a battle between Heironeous and his half brother Hextor was raged on the plains of what is our world.

While Heironeous and Hextor were not always enemies, this all changed quickly when Hextor chose to directly interfere with the world and burn down a city on the east coast of an island called Enfellthor. Coming to terms with the fact that he and his brother were on opposite sides of the moral compass, Heironeous decided (after a long personal argument) that his brother must be stopped and he must sever ties with him once and for all.

Being as his brother was the God of war, he knew he must think of a strategy to win when the final confrontation would occur. Heironeous then spoke to Celestian. He asked him to construct him a weapon that he could use to defeat his brother, regardless of the strategy he would use. This was not a war that Heironeous was willing to sacrifice human life in, and that he must confront his brother personally, in human form.

Celestian created the weapon that Heironeous asked for and told Heironeous that he would one day contact him for payment. Heironeous went to the world of mortals and called to the sky, demanding that Hextor come down and face him like a man. When Hextor arrived, he was all but confident that this would be the end of his brother. But Hextor was ill-prepared for what Heironeous had in store for him.

The first thing that Hextor noticed when arriving to the world, was his brother’s shimmering new gauntlets. Coated in black gold and platinum, the gauntlets were a sight to behold. Hextor knew that when he finally slayed his brother, he would take them for himself and all would marvel in their beauty. When he noticed that his brother was not carrying a weapon, Hextor took his gleaming hammer off of his back, and swung down at Heironeous. Heironeous put up his arm, and what happened next, Hextor could hardly believe.

A large wall-shield had appeared out of no where, attached to Heironeous’ arm. The hammer crashed down on the shield and Heironeous pushed the hammer away. Backing up, Heironeous’ shield disappeared, and was replaced by a great sword in either hand. The weight of the weapons seemed to be that of a feather, and everything that the gauntlets made appear seemed to be but a ghostly, glowing figure of what was actually there.

The war raged and Heironeous’ gauntlets worked marvels. The gauntlets could make any weapon or shield appear. Bows, infinite arrows, large hammers, swords, and daggers, no weapon was too much for the gloves. Once the battle was through, and Hextor lie on the ground, defeated, Heironeous commanded him to return to the heavens and never return or interfere again. Hextor agreed and disappeared. Heironeous looked down at the gauntlets and decided he no longer needed them because the threat was gone. He took the gauntlets to a part of the world where many had been slain and evil was so great that no one could ever reach the powerful weapon.

There has been word that this weapon still exists, and it’s power has grown over time.
