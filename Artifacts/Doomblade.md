*Fantasy Sword by [vicini](https://www.deviantart.com/vicini).*

Doomblade is a sword that is only talked about in Myth. It is said that over a thousand years ago, there was a sword that was so powerful, that it needed to be locked away. The sword was somewhat of an odd creation. It was designed to give massive power to whomever wields it, but only for one year. After that one year is up, the warrior who wields it will not only die a death that can never be broken, but their soul will be cast down to the underworld and fed on by Lord Orcus himself.

Some believe that this sword was the weapon of choice for the god Nerull. He crafted the sword so that all who tried to oppose his power would be dragged to the underworld no matter what. Of course, that is just a myth.
