This fortress has a room that contains the means and scroll for the “Consult Oracle” ritual. Another area outside is inscribed as a “Planar Portal.” A room deep within the citadel contains a mirror that is imbued with the “Observe Creature” ritual.

The only others within the citadel are about 30 or so Chosen Souls that have gotten a second chance after death by serving the cause of the God’s Chosen.

The citadel is host to barracks, feasting quarters, & a training dojo. Many other chambers are yet to be discovered!

## After the Starfire Calamity

After the Starfire Calamity, the God's Chosen mostly settled at [New Haven](/Atlas/Kandalur/Realms/RisingLands/Settlements/NewHaven.md). No record exists on where the Sky Citadel ended up.
