# Quest for Starfire Adventure Logs
*This is not a complete set of adventure logs. Rather, its documenting all of the session logs we kept.*

## Introduction
One fateful night, during a violent electrical storm, 3 adventurers sought shelter together in an abandoned tor. Argarwane, the rogue with no memory, Chigaru, the mysterious deva, and Vengeance, the lone tiefling started out on a journey that would change their fates along with the fate of the world.

In the town of Stallcroft on that fateful night, they were told the prophecy of a coming evil by the wizard Petendithas Oaklord. They would begin the journey that could save this world. 
A mysterious being, known only as Starfire, was creating something so powerful that it could challenge the gods. With the fall of the Nerathi Empire nearly 200 years in the past, everyone is fighting for power. The heroes must learn more of Starfire and find him before it is too late. No being should possess power beyond that of the gods. Will they succeed? Will Starfire claim the power of the gods? Will the world be thrown into war? Only the heroes can determine the fate of the world…

## Genesis
*2010 December 4*

Three strangers met in the wilderness during a violent electrical storm. They ran into each other while looking for cover from the hail and lightning. They found it in an old tor built into a mountainside. Introductions and backgrounds were given. Chigaru the assassin Deva remained mostly quiet and mysterious. Vengeance the warden Tiefling took it upon himself to find out more about the others. Agarwane the rogue Human was quite reserved. 
Chigaru has lived thousands of lifetimes being reborn into new bodies after each. Vengeance once led a famed group of warriors into battle many times before being imprisoned. Agarwane remembers nothing. His past has been lost. 
The strangers fight their way through the tor finding treasures and defeating villains. After defeating the zombie bugbear knight that the tomb was created for, Vengeance found himself with a magic weapon forged in the fires of the very blade he’d always carried with him. The adventurers then left the tor as the storm had calmed a bit and headed into the woods. There they met Widgeon, a bard gnome whose home had been taken from him. They defeated the kobolds responsible and let Widgeon take them to the nearest town. There they met a strange rider who knows Agarwane by name. Chigaru saw visions of this shadowy figure riding from the Misty Kingdom. The rider agreed to meet them at the inn at sun-up to talk more.

## In the Mountain
*2010 December 10*

Chigaru, Agarwane, and Vengeance awoke at the inn. They were told to meet an old man in Stallcroft. The old wizard known as Petendithas Oaklord told the players that they have a much bigger future than they realize. They were instructed to travel to the Misty Kingdom with the “sun-up rider,” Graster Arroway. They took Widgeon the gnome along. They fought through the Western Woods and entered a dungeon beneath the northern mountains. Here they found a secret study with an interesting journal entry.
The dungeon began growing colder and they noticed ice covering the pillars and walls. Moments later they were face to face with a young white dragon. This was where he was making his lair and his ice cold stare made it known that visitors were not allowed. An EPIC battle ensued. Agarwane was knocked unconscious. Vengeance met the shadow of death but a true friend stepped in and brought him back to life. Widgeon, giving all he had, sang a song of resurrection on his lute. This pulled Vengeance away from death’s cold hands. Widgeon fell unconscious with exhaustion. And it would be the war-pick of Chigaru that brought the dragon to its end. The adventurers took a much needed rest.

## Welcome to the Misty Kingdom
*2010 December 15*

After our adventurers gathered their wits from a rest, they made their way through the mountain being led by dwarves they had just met. They made it through the mountain and to the Misty Kingdom. In the city of Asalia, they met King Antoban Heroldi who had a favor to ask. They were to rid Mt. Promontor of Kalarel and his evil sorcery. 
Chigaru visited the the scholar at the castle and studied the mountains and the history. He also got more information regarding the strange text he found in the mountain. But the information was limited. To gain more he must travel to Brightkeep in the Feywild. King Heroldi can help him get there. 
The adventurers set out to the mountain and entered. They destroyed charmed statues and escaped traps before finally meeting Kalarel in his sanctuary. He was attempting to summon a portal for the demon lord Orcus to enter the world from the Shadowfell. After a trying battle and near-death, our adventurers destroyed Kalarel and took his body back to the king. Misty Kingdom was released from the grip of evil and returned to its beautiful and good state. Would King Heroldi now uphold the promises he made for payment? Would he lead them to the Feywild?

## Searching for Brightkeep
*2010 December 23*

Our adventurers set out for the Realm of the Vines seeking the city of Grennal and an elf named Rolen. On the way out of the city, [Baurus](/Characters/Baurus.md) the dwarf met them. He was an old friend of Chigaru’s and seeks treasure so he joined the group. They fought their way through panthers and spiders and discovered the Axe of Terror. They swiftly defeated two demons guarding the treasure and Baurus obtained it. 
Once in Grennal, they wasted no time finding Rolen and getting out. The tiefling and the dwarf did not feel comfortable in the presence of elves. Rolen led them to a crossing point to the Feywild and they were able to cross over. They defeated three Eladrin knights to gain access to Brightkeep.
Inside Brightkeep, they discovered new clues to the mystery of Starfire and new information on the past of Argarwane. Vengeance was able to locate the head wizard and obtain information on where to travel next. Will they travel there? Will they stay at Brightkeep and continue searching through the knowledge within?

## Fallcrest
*2011 January 3*

As we started to leave, Aranil met with us and told us that Starfire had indeed been to Brightkeep. But it had been a number of years since he had seen him. Aranil then offered to take us to the last known place Starfire had been. Aranil then magically teleported us to the city of Fallcrest. After talking with several townfolk, we decided the best place to ask around for information would be the local taphouses and inns. We first went to the Netter Inn where we met a noble tiefling. Who told us about the Markelhay family and the power they have. Next we ventured to the the Blue Moon Ale House where we met Sergeant Murgeddin the head of the Guards. He told us about Old Man Markelhay who during the Great War took the family heirloom, a sword, and hid it in the Guardmore Abbey and was not seen again. Upon hearing this we decided to visit the Lucky Gnome Taphouse to see if there was anymore information available. Upon entering we started talking with Kelson who talked about the gang problem in Low Town. Upon venturing into Low Town we talk to an individual and they tell us about the River Rats, which is the gang that plagues this part of town at night. We then decide that it would be in the best interest to venture to the Abbey and retrive this sword of power. Upon leaving town we were stopped by a messenger of Armos Kamroth who was summoning us to his estate to discuss something. Upon entering Armos Kamroth‘s estate we were given a very well prepared meal and asked to retrive the Markelhay heirloom from the Abbey. Kamroth being a collector has an artifact that would enhance the sword and is willing to give us the artifact and the sword on the completion of the job. We then took our leave to find Moonbane, the family heirloom sword. Upon arriving at the Abbey we notice we are not alone. There are many Orcs and other creatures that have taken refuge here. After defeating the Orcs, Drake, and solving the riddle to gain entrance to a sanctuary where we find an alter with a void of what appears to be something with wings which has been taken. We search for the sword but at first glance there is nothing to find but an empty sack, but upon Boris sticking his hand into the bag he finds it! Upon completing the quest we immediately head back to Armos Kamroth’s estate only to find no one. We enter cautiously trying to find him, in the basement we do find a secret door which reveals a staircase and we proceed. We then take the left and go down a hallway into a study where we find a sheet of paper titled Incoming Goods which has our names on it and Moonbane, Kelson with Incoming Supplies next to his name, Bartstorman Strongbeard. Kelson’s and Strongbeards names are crossed off. And finally on the list Starfire with the Wings of Bahamet next to his name. Downs the other study we find a map of with Teldorthian Arms circled. We then listen to the double doors in the middle of the landing and the foot of the stairs to the conversations inside where we find out that someone thinks that Starfire has ran with his item. We then enter and preceed to lie to Kamroth about not finding the sword but leave the two shortswords we did find with him for him to inspect. We then try to figure someway we could stop the corruption that Kamroth is causing on this town.

## Defeating the Tomb of Shadows
*2011 July 26*

*Finally out of there!*
You feel the darkness enclosing around you. Within seconds, all is dark.

You can see your friends are with you in the darkness with the exception of Thalion. Suddenly, there is a flash that cuts through the darkness, temporarily blinding you. When you can see again, your vision is blurred. It appears a long hallway stands before you. Two doors stand on either side.

Door 1 – You can see Brightkeep, in the Feywild. A group of wizards sit around a large table with grim looks upon their faces. You recognize a few of them. Their sadness reaches out to you.

Door 2 – You see an underground dwarven city, trapped between the very planes of existence. The cries of the dwarves strike terror into your soul.

Door 3 – A familiar kingdom lies before your eyes. Algoria. But it looks nothing like it did. Flames engulf the countryside and cities are in ruins. You can hear the cries of women and children.

Door 4 – You can see Greyhawk. Suddenly, a large army, covered in darkness storms across it. The lands are filled with the darkness as it continues to grow. It strikes fear into your soul.

The next room is strange. Through the glass floor, you can see the world. Familiar faces reach up to you with a look of terror on their faces. You can see King Heroldi, the dwarves of Hammerfast, Oaklord, the elves of the forest all reaching out to you. Yet they cannot reach you. Petendithas Oaklord holds a scroll in one hand that comes close to the surface beneath your feet, yet does not cross into the room. King Heroldi holds his hand out with a small statuette of a unicorn. It does not cross into the room either.
The PCs acquired the scroll (planar portal ritual) and the unicorn statuette (a unicorn summons).

Perception DC 25 – The ceiling has images of the gods. Their eyes lie not on the people below, but rather on the doorway ahead. A look of slight worry, unusual for the gods, is upon their faces.

The next room resembles the last in shape. But that’s about it. This room has all its energy focused upon a single chest at the far end of it. The chest is the most elaborate you have ever seen. It radiates a golden light from it. Three dark figures in hoods stand guarding it. Their gaze has been upon you since you entered the room.
If the PCs move forward, the drow attack.
When you open the chest, its as if you begin flying through the sky. Clouds begin passing you at tremendous speeds. You can see a large city in the sky ahead. As you approach it, you see a castle. Next thing you know, you are in the castle staring at a large window overlooking the city. A strange figure stands in front of it staring at the stars in wonderment. He turns and says, “The Gaze is coming.”

The players land back in the Shadow Tomb. Thalion is waiting. They fill him in on what just happened. The group next attempts to cross the bone bridge in the ossuary. Two phantoms manifest with an army of skeletal beings. The PCs, luckily, identify the undead as more than mindless. They are warriors protecting their resting place. Through a skill challenge, the PCs are able to earn the trust and respect of the undead and cross safely.

Next they find the remains of the shader-kai who entered the tomb before them. They find a journal that speaks of Acerak and his phylactery. Finally, the find the shadow engine room. This room is channeling all of the energy from this place to some unknown location. An aspect of Acerak, in the form of a floating skull, attacks as the PCs try and disable the engine. They make quick work of the engine, but Acerak takes a little more time. Thalion is able to fly thanks to his boots and Shadow is able to invoke the wrath of the gods with is new rod implement. In a moment of desperation, Shadow summons a fire angel. He rides on the wings of the angel to Acerak, who is floating high above the battlefield with no need for melee combat. With a leap of faith, Shadow drives his blade into the skull and it explodes with arcane energy. The Shadow Tomb has been defeated.

Using their newly acquired portal ritual, the PCs return to Algoria so Argarwane can rule. He equips them all with special gear before they next set out to find the man who stole their Bag of Holding.

## Finding Quinn
*2011 July 26*

*Let's get that bastard...*

The group heads to Hammerfast to find details about the whereabouts of Quinn Morlin. Quinn had previously stolen their Bag of Holding. They want it back. They gain the knowledge that he is in the trading town of Nenlast. A dwarf named Jarel Hammerthorn agrees to show them the way if they will guard his caravan that he is taking there. They agree.
They meet Rendar the half-orc fighter who also has agreed to see that the caravan makes its journey safely. The journey is a day and a half. They endure a harsh lightning storm and an attack from ogres and orcs. Three also finds and heals a hurt dire wolf. He decides to bring it along.
In the town of Nenlast, the characters hit the Hawk Tavern. “The best Ale in the Nentir Vale!” the sign outside reads. Jarel ends up sending them to the sewers to look for Jaerys Foxstone. He is a famed adventurer and surely he can locate Quinn. They battle through the sewers fighting aboleths until the reach Jaerys’ lair. They retrieve a special item by fighting more aboleths, cyclops, and a golem. Finally, they endure a combat encounter with Jaerys who turns out to be Quinn. He gives them treasures and asks to join their quest. They agree and get their Bag of Holding back. Finally!

### GM Only
Hammerfast
The PCs can gain the knowledge (Streetwise DC 24) that Quinn Morlin usually resides in Nenlast. 
Jarel Hammerthorn can lead them to Nenlast if they agree to guard his caravan along the way. It’s about 40 miles from Hammerfast. It requires a day and a half of travel.

Journey to Nenlast
The first 10 miles is on the King’s Road. During this part of the journey, a wild storm arises over the road. A DC 20 Endurance check is required to not lose a healing surge.
As the characters turn north from the King’s Road, they are attacked.

XP 5000
3 lvl 15 Orc Mercenaries
4 lvl 16 Ogre Bludeoneers 
The total gold on the orc bodies is 5000gp.

Shortly after traveling about 10 miles north, you hear a growling and whimpering in the woods to the right of the road. If the PCs examine, read this: A wolf, dire wolf by the looks of it, is caught in a claw trap. It’s obvious that poachers are responsible. The wolf is not dead but in bad shape. It’s caught around his neck and he is bleeding profusely.
If Three chooses to heal the wolf, it becomes slightly attached to him (although not obedient yet).

Nenlast
Towards midday, you reach the town of Nenlast. Nenlast sits on the shores of Lake Nen. The town is surrounded by high stone walls with a group of guards at the entrance.

Nenlast Sewers
The sewers are ankle high in sludge and it often rises to knee high. Strangely, you notice gargoyles set into the corners of each room. It looks as if these weren’t always just sewers…you can hear splashing noises every few moments from the corridor straight ahead. The corridor to your left smells strongly of sulfur.
Two corridors exit this room. Two gargoyles have their eyes set upon the third who rests between the two corridors. He looks to be less perched like the others. This one…is on guard.
This hallway wraps around leading to the same room you just came from. A Perception DC 24 notices that one entire wall has VERY small cracks all over it. It could be weak. Inside this chamber rests the statue of a hero. An Arcana DC 22 recognizes the magic item, the “stone band” on his finger.
Thick clouds of sulfur spurt from the ground every few seconds in this chamber. The clouds are thick and appear at random. Refer to Sulfur Spewers Trap. When the first PC crosses the line in this room, monsters rise from the sludge and sulfur and attack! This encounter includes: 1 aboleth slime mage, 2 aboleth lashers, and 9 kuo-toa guards. This encounter is worth 9950 XP
A wooden door sits on the far wall. Gold hinges and hardware look out of place on this door set in the sewers.

Jaerys Foxstone’s Lair
1. This corridor leads to a small set of stairs. Atop the stairs are two doorways and two guards eyeing you curiously as you enter. The guards will ask the business of the adventurers. A skill challenge will allow the adventurers by. If they reveal a magic item to the guards, they are allowed to enter the door on the right. “If you can retrieve the magic item from beyond this door, you will be granted an audience with Jaerys Foxstone.” Perception DC 22 notices the gargoyles at the back end. Perception DC 27 notices the secret door.
2. You descend a staircase about 10 feet into a room dimly lit with torches. It resembles the sewers and the floor is covered in sewage and sludge to about ankle height. A lone, stone gargoyle watches over the room from the corner. Two doors are at the far end. When two characters have crossed the middle line, the Aboleth Overseer and 8 aboleth servitors arise from the ground. If anyone enters the corner by the gargoyle, he attacks. Otherwise he attacks during the 3rd round of combat. This encounter is worth 8800 XP
3. When the door has been open for one minute, it suddenly slams shut. The room is overcome by a magical darkness. One minute later, the door opens and any characters inside have lost one magic item.
4. This room has a pyramid structure in the middle of it that rises about 15 feet high. Atop it you can see a bright glowing statue of a phoenix. A golem steps out of the front stone wall and roars as six cyclops step out from behind the pyramid. An Athletics DC 25 is required to climb the pyramid on the steep sides. An Athletics DC 15 is required to climb either stairs. This encounter is worth 7400 XP Atop the pyramid is the glowing statue of a phoenix wearing a belt. The belt is the Phoenix Sash. The guards at the entrance will let the PCs pass if they show this item.
5. The two rooms in the hallway lead to empty barracks. Between the two rooms the PCs can find about 15,000 gp. The stairway descends into a large open room. Six men sit at a table playing dice and toying with strange items you are not familiar with. There are bookshelves and desks all around the room and hundreds of strange objects and paintings you have never seen before.
“Welcome gentlemen. And to what do I owe the honor of your company?”
“If you can defeat the great ”/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/jaerys-foxstone" class=“wiki-content-link”>Jaerys Foxstone in combat, I shall indeed lead you to your fellow ‘Quinn’ friend. Gentlemen! Prepare for battle!"
Two human blade nobles, four archers, and Jaerys Foxstone attack! **This encounter is worth 10,300 XP**

Quinn will give them back their bag of holding along with 5 gems worth 5000 gp each. He will also give them two gifts. The Essence of the Scout is the first. He also offers to inscribe a magical tattoo on someone. This is the Eager Hero’s Tattoo. Quinn also has a question for the group about a Starfire. He read a scroll in the bag of holding. He wishes to help them. He’s still capable of great adventures and tells them his next location so they can send him word when they need his help.

Treasure found during level 16:
lvl 17 Stone Band
lvl 18 Phoenix Sash
lvl 19 Essence of the Scout
lvl 20 Eager Hero’s Tattoo
25,000gp
15,000gp
5000gp

## Skull City
*2011 August 1*
### GM Only
The players are at the Nen Inn in Nenlast. Quinn returns to them in the morning with some valuable information. He has a source (although he is not willing to name them) that has information on Starfire. He needs 10,000gp to buy the information though. If they agree, the PCs learn the following:
“Starfire is indeed creating a weapon of sorts. Details on that, I have none. However, my source indicates that Starfire voiced concerns about one known as Acerak. Do you know this name?
Well, I have one clue that may help us to the next location for adventure! He left me with the words…Skull City. Apparently, there is reason to believe that a great weapon lies within the tomb there. Even Starfire himself, did not dare attempt to get it.

Arrive at Skull City – 2000 XP
Destroy Moghadam – 10,000 XP

## Skull Island
*2011 August 10*

*The Tomb Awaits...*

Joined by Quinn the adventurers leave Algoria and Argawane behind once more as they approach the true Tomb of Horrors. They receive word from a contact of Quinn’s that their next destination is Skull Island. Upon reaching the beach to set out to the island they are accosted by a gnome who bears the symbol of Algoria. The gnome reveals himself to be a bard, and good friend of the king of Algoria known as Widgeon. Utilizing an enchanted feather found earlier on the quest, the newly expanded group of adventurers set out for Skull Island. Once on the island they head toward a great skull shaped rock in the center of a city. This leads to several encounters with undead as well as the three warring factions on the island. Finally defeated in combat with several powerful warriors, the adventurers find themselves guests of the Skullbreakers, a group of adventurers who have previously braved the Tomb of Horrors and failed in their quests leaving them scarred either mentally or physically. After bestowing upon the party a few gifts, they stand ready to enter the Tomb and face whatever terrors lie inside.

## The Tomb of Horrors
*2011 August 11*

*A great evil manifests itself around the party as well as inside one of them...*

The brave party enters the tomb crafted by a mad priest and accolade of the Demilich Acerak, and finds it to be a treacherous labyrinth testing their bodies as well as minds. Each of the encounters in the mazelike Tomb leaves its mark on the adventurers in one way or another. The first being the least taxing, though still leaving the party fatigued and confused. The second encounter took place in a horrible mockery of a burial chamber wherein the party encountered two mummies, and managed to lay three more to rest. However this encounter was not without its dangers, as Thalion was struck a deadly blow by one of the mummies, causing him to contract the mummy’s rot plague. The final encounter found the party fighting a bewitched eladrin woman, as well as each other due to a dangerous spell being cast by a hallway coated in runes. After surviving the encounter and helping the save the woman from the mists of madness caused by the runes the party returned to the Skullbreakers’ haven. Unfortunately, during the rest that the party took in this place Thalion’s condition worsened requiring Quinn and Widgeon to be sent to mainland in an attempt to find a cure. The party’s only option now is to return to a newfound passage in the Tomb and pray that help arrives before it is too late for Thalion…

## A Death and An Oath
*2011 August 19*

*A party member falls as a greater quest reveals itself.*

After days of battling the disease infesting his body Thalion’s will finally gave way and he succumbed to the Mummy’s Rot. The remaining members of the party remained in the sanctuary of the Skullbreakers as Three sent a message to Quinn and Widgeon hastening their return to the island. Upon their arrival the group returned to the tomb and descended into a recently discovered trapdoor in the floor. Traveling further into the tomb and battling horrors along the way, the party discovers a seemingly harmless room with a jewel adorned skull sitting on a pedestal in the center of it. Quinn took the skull and triggered a trap opening the floor below him into the darkness of the inner temple. The party traveled down into the depths leading to a large circular room. However, as the entered, the cackling wraith of the mad priest Moghadam. Though victory seemed distant for a greater part of the battle, Three made a desperate final strike against the wraith and slew it. As it turned to shadow and disintegrated its magical sword dropped to the ground. Three approached the sword and when he stooped to pick it up, a voice was heard in his head asking if he would swear an oath to see the Demilich Acerak destroyed. Three took up the oath in the name of Haramathur and thus Ruinblade was his.

## New Places, New Faces
*2011 August 28*

### GM Only
Recap then read Neal’s intro to the Tor

The Messenger
You can hear a galloping sound outside of the tor and a man yelling, “Help! Please Help!”

You see a horse lying dead with arrows sticking out from its side. A man scrambles up the hill towards you, holding out a scroll in one hand. “Please-” the resounding THUD interrupts his speech as an arrow tip emerges from his chest. He falls to the ground at your feet and the scroll falls from his hand. Seven riders approach you on horseback.

“Sorry for the noise, gentlemen. He’s a common thief so if you’ll please return that scroll to us we will be on our way.”

Perception DC 25 – the dead man wears nicer clothes than most thieves
Insight DC 25 – the man on horseback does not appear to be very honest
History DC 25 – the riders’ clothing and armor speak that they hail from Risencrest in the Rising Lands

The men will dismount and fight if the PCs do not cooperate. The men will not wait long, either.
5200 XP 
-Human Blade Noble
-2 Human Snipers
-4 Human Soldier Minions

Crossing the Rising River
A wide stone bridge crosses the river ahead of you. At each end, two towers flank an iron portcullis guarding entrance to the bridge. Three men stand behind the bars of iron watching you as you approach.

Perception DC 29 – You notice arrow slits along various portions of the two towers.
History DC 25 – This location, known as The Cross, is one of only two bridges across the Rising River. The other bridge is in Maransa.

“Evening, gents. No passage thru The Cross, I’m afraid. Queen Marvella has commanded it. Only her royal guard is allowed through.”

Skill Challenge Complexity 2, Level 20 – 6 successes before 3 failures, 5600 XP
Primary
Diplomacy DC 30 – The players try to convince the guards of their true intentions
Bluff DC 26 – The players lie to gain passage
Intimidate DC 30 – The player uses fear tactics
Secondary
History – Use history of The Cross to gain a +2 to next Diplomacy
Perception – Use your keen senses to gain a +2 to any of the checks
Success – The players are granted access.
Failure – The players must cross the river by other means

The river is 60 feet across with a strong current towards the sea. Athletics DC 20 to move your speed minus 1. The penalty is to stay afloat. The current pulls you 2 squares to the sea for every 3 you move forward.

Sneaking Into Risencrest Before Sun-Up
An vast city lies before you in the dark of night. Few buildings even have light leading you to believe it must be deep into the night hours. High stone walls surround the city. A large gate leads into the city but it is closed.

The only way in is to climb the walls. Athletics DC 27 to climb. Athletics DC 15 to climb with a rope.

The PCs must stealthily navigate the city walls and get into the castle this way. Each round for 3 rounds, the players must make a DC 22 Stealth check in order to keep hidden and not make noise. If a player fails, the nearest guards will attack. The players have 2 rounds to quiet the guards before more show up. If 3 separate garrisons see them, the players are in a lot of trouble.

-1 Garrison = 7 Human Soldier Minions = 2100 XP

-7000 XP awarded for getting in unnoticed

You find a passageway that leads you down into the courtyard of the grand castle just as the first light of day is approaching over the distant hills. The doors to the castle are open and a woman stands in a cloud of mist. She looks right at you and begins to laugh. She points behind you to a man standing in the shadows. As he emerges, you notice the green fire in his eyes. Three make a history check. Sudden dread overcomes you as you recall the name Samael…and in a burst of green flame that throws you to the ground, the man transforms into the legendary dragon before your very eyes.

12,000 XP 
Elder Green Dragon

When Samael gets down to 150 hit points or less, he takes flight screaming, “Wretched witch! You’re not worth the trouble! As for you, brave adventurers, you have not seen the last of Samael!”

Defeating Marvella
With the dragon slain, you turn your attention to the doors of the castle. Yet, they do not open.

The entrance hall to Castle Risencrest is a large open area. Pillars line both sides and a slight mist hovers above the ground. A strange form appears in at the far end. She eyes you with a death glare. Knights begin to emerge from the darkness.

8950 XP
Marvella (Mist Hag)
2 Blaspheme Knight Keepers

If the bodies are searched, the PCs will find Marvella’s Crystal Ball. (lvl 20 Crystal Ball of Spying) She also has a spellbook with only 1 spell in it. All the other pages are blank. “Right here from nothing at all, bring about my fortunes without the crystal ball.” If read aloud, a chest appears and opens with 48,000 gp inside.

*The Cursed City...*

### GM Only
Greeting at the Mines
The street leading to the mine is lined on both sides with rundown buildings that tower up to 4 stories high. The dim light inside the buildings tips you off that they are still occupied. What do you do?
The buildings are almost all homes to miners and/or their families. A strange glow also comes from deep within the mine. If the PCs search any homes, they will meet miners familiar with both Larg, the old mine leader, and the Rising Fall.

As you approach the entrance, a door in the building nearest it opens. Two dwarves, two humans, and a female elf step out and block the entrance to the mine. They are all dressed in black cloaks with a red symbol on their gloves. Insight DC 27 alerts them that the symbol represents the Rising Fall.

The elf speaks, “I am Faelis. A representative of the Fall. What is your business here?
Faelis will not allow the PCs into the mines as she already knows their business. She will either kill them or send them to jail. The Rising Fall sent her on a suicide mission to slow the PCs. This band carries nothing on them of value.

Within the Deepening Stalls
The first level of the mines looks eerily similar to the entrance. Rundown buildings line the cave walls and three tunnels branch off from the chamber. The two tunnels on the sides appear normal yet the central tunnel entrance is adorned with stones and writings in a strange language. It is also the only tunnel that has been collapsed. The central tunnel is mined by dwarves. The others are mined by everyone else. All tunnels will eventually get the PCs to the Deepest Stall. They will find the treasure and see less detailed workings. Realizing that time is against you, you decide that whichever path you take, you will take it to the end. There is no time to backtrack.

You travel deeper into the earth, level by level, realizing that as you descend, the buildings and structures slowly become more appealing. The structures you begin to see are no longer ruins but in fact newer, more aesthetically pleasing buildings. After a few hours, you reach a corridor that descends into darkness. Refer to random dungeon.

This chamber is covered in treasures. Gold and jewels spill from chests scattered about the room. A lone dwarf stands over a furnace resembling a forge. A large sword with strange writings glows red and sits on the edge of the forge. Without even turning around, the dwarf speaks, “Workers are to remain at work or return to their quarters. Being here, ye deny them both. Ye better have a damned good excuse ready.” The dwarf lifts a warhammer from a nearby table. Larg is forging the Blade of Elemental Chaos for Elkantar. He is in no mood to talk and when the PCs mention the Rising Fall OR Starfire he attacks. Two elite dwarf guards join him from an adjoining room along with any that the PCs missed along the way. After the first round of battle, the fire drake enters from his chamber.

Larg lowers on one knee and raises a hand, "Stop! Starfire is at Castle Maelok with Elkantar Mal’Een as we speak. The lift over there leads directly into the Castle Forge. It’ll have you there in minutes. If the PCs leave the dwarf, he will hurl his warhammer with deadly accuracy at one of them from behind and rush in. He will not let them leave without a fight and he will not go with them. The PCs will either remember the Blade or it will call to them. Near it, in the flames is a piece of charred paper. It is a letter from Baurus.
Treasure in this room includes: 700 pp, Blade of Elemental Chaos, two potions of vitality, lvl 20 Jarring Hammer

Castle Maelok
You arrive in a small room lit only by the fires of a forge. A lone dwarf is working a piece of metal into a sword. He jumps when he sees you and draws his axe. This dwarf is Ironhewe. He is of good alignment and a prisoner of the Rising Fall. The forge is actually locked. If the PCs can help him escape, he can take them directly to the throne room.

The halls of Castle Maelok are extremely quiet and empty. Your footsteps create a slight echo against the marble floors. You arrive at the doors to the throne room and you can hear voices on the other side. A sudden scream of anger rises from the room with a flash of great light. The sound of glass shattering follows. When the PCs go in they see a large broken window behind the throne. A drow stands in the middle of the group of soldiers and points in your direction, “Kill them! They’re with him!” A fresh stream of blood falls from a newly made scar on his face.

Throughout the fight, Elkantar will shout things such as, “You will pay for what he did!” and “Wretched followers! Your master will see you in the nine hells!” If questioned while alone, Elkantar Mal’Een will reveal that Starfire stole the Fallen Stone from his very hands. He offered to pay but Mal’Een refused. The Fallen Stone can enchant anything beyond imagining. The amount of magic flowing through it is incredible.

After the fight the PCs learn that Starfire has fled for the docks. The Cloak of the Walking wounded is the treasure for this room. Elkantar wears it.

## Welcome to the Astral Sea
*2012 March 11*

### GM Only
Ashfilar. The Land of 1000 Spires. Before it lies the city of Regalhier. The stone-walled city rests between two mountains and grants the only access to Ashfilar from the south. A divine energy once surged here. All 1027 spires once united in channeling the most powerful forces this side of the Astral Sea. A famous dungeon, Alshanir, lies underneath the central spire. The Sorcerer of Alshanir is one of the most-famed legends in the history of the Astral Sea. He holds a crystal that is to be sought for great power.

The central chamber is covered in long-forgotten runes and glyphs that shed light no more. A lone crystal sits on a pedestal in the middle of the room. The PCs must gather all the gems from surrounding rooms to deactivate the ward protecting the crystal. Once the ward is gone, the crystal shatters creating an explosion leaving the PCs prone and dazed. The Sorcerer of Alshanir has been set free…

4 rooms require challenges in order to collect the sacred gems. “Your soul be damned before the crystal you shall take. Find the lost gems and a friend you might make.”

Black Gem 
-The PC who grabs it will slow time and see black flames on everything as it moves in slow motion. Every round the PC takes 40 points of damage. Round 2: weapon disappears. Round 3: Curse of Black Flame (Ongoing 20 damage). Round 4: Dazed, save ends. Round 5: Lose half speed.
Purple Gem (in the final room) (only escape is to attack an ally) Escape is only an attack away…do what you would not
-The PCs are separated and think they are in the room with 1 ally. This is not the case. It’s a visual trick and they are being attacked by these deceptions. Each deception has HP equal to its PCs bloodied value. Once a deception is destroyed the PC is teleported to the gem.
Green Gem (hiding underneath the floor) (hear it by tapping)
-Banesworn in the laboratory. Potions cause terribly dangerous environment. 
Red Gem (hiding in the head of a suit of armor)
-Devil Fight

## The Wizard's Crystal
*2012 March 26*

*Sacrifices are made, and old friends return.*

Upon arriving in the Astral Sea, the party suddenly hears a scuffle happening on the deck of the pirate ship they occupy. Coming up to the deck, the party sees the pirates that had been manning their ship slain by a small group of black cloaked strangers. The strangers lead the party to a man who had taken over the duty of flying the ship. When asked of his intentions by Three, the man explained where they were headed and stated that soon they would “understand everything”. Soon the ship docked and the party was taken to a fortress built into a mountain where the Shardmind Ilnedra was waiting. She explained that though the party had undertaken many quests, all were secondary to slowing the progress of Starfire, who was working in the Astral Sea at present, collecting artifacts and acting as the de facto servant of the goddess Erathis. However it was believed that his servitude was more out of convenience of gaining power and resources rather than for the greater good. The party was then sent to the island of 1,000 spires to find the next artifact of importance to Starfire, a crystal that once belonged to a great and terrible wizard. After hours of searching they found the spire belonging to the wizard and entered to search for the crystal. The party then began collecting gems within the spire, falling prey to the traps that each of the gems required to collect them, as well as battles with the servants of the evil god Bane, and devils as well. Once the gems were collected and used to unlock the magic seal on the wizard’s crystal the party was teleported to the top and forced to battle the newly freed wizard who owned the crystal and had been sealed for the good of the people living on the island. After a brief but nearly costly battle the party vanquished the wizard causing an explosion that forced them all off the spire to the ground far below. As the party raced to regroup and help the badly injured Three, several Mind Flayer’s appeared and immediately attacked the group. When all seemed lost, a huge axe flew forth from the blowing sand and cleaved the largest Mind Flayer in half. When the two others fled, Baurus stepped forward and introduced himself to the shocked party.

## Aspects of Evil
*2012 June 3*

*Gems, Evil, and Aetius*

While our heroes continue their adventure, they find themselves back in the room in which they previously left off. While some of the party prays to the pool and the God it represents, Lomian finds two gems wrapped around a vampire’s neck. As Lomian a-tunes the gems, the rest of the party looks about the area. After much thought, the party returns to the previous room they were in and decide to go through a different portal than the first time. The room they arrive in has many dead bodies and constructs. The constructs come to life and attack the heroes. While the battle rages, a familiar face comes stumbling out of the portal behind our heroes, the blind companion known as Aetius has returned. Relieved to see their friend, the heroes were whole again. Once the final enemy had met his match, the Gods’ Chosen began to search the room. Weapons, armor, and a blood-colored symbol occupied the room. The symbol represented Kord’s brother, Tuern, who was slain in the past by Kord’s evil brother. Another gem was also found and Lomian a-tunes it and puts it on his belt. The heroes then elect for Ginroy to step through a swirling portal, he describes to the rest of the party what he sees. He describes a demon, followers, and a purple gem. The party decides to try a bit of a long shot attack. The party decides on shooting magic through the portal to get the upper hand on the demons. As soon as the first shot is fired, the portal closes, and Ginroy is on his own. The party quickly tries to re-open the portal. Seeing that the portal cannot be opened again, the party frantically tries another portal. They eventually meet up with Ginroy (who has been talking his way out of an early grave) and are prepared to defend their friend. In the room, a giant tentacled monster rises from the pool in the middle during the battle, the true battle had just begun. The Aspect of Vector also made an appearance, but was overcome by The Gods’ Chosen. After the battle, the heroes searched through more portals and found their way back to the Shadowfell. After a small encounter with some unfriendly ghosts, the heroes found their way back to the tapestry room they had previously passed through. The tapestries depicted pictures of Demogorgon and Orcus. While searching the chamber, aspects of both Demogorgon and Orcus appear before the party and begin their assault. After a display of acrobatics and power, Stellion brought down Demogorgon in two final blows. After trading blows with the aspect of Orcus, Gahthak eventually severs Orcus into two. The Gods’ Chosen returned to the room they began in and rested. The end of this nightmare felt the nearest it had ever felt.

## The Unlikely Three
*2012 July 3*

Our heroes found themselves in the dark area they had previously explored. This time they could feel the end of this horror draw near. They first came across a room with an odd man from the Fae, he was interested in playing a game. The heroes easily defeated the man in the game (due to some slight cheating) and the man became very angry. A battle broke out and after the heroes began to win, the man disappeared (assumedly back to the Fae.) The God’s Chosen carried on and found themselves in a frightening room with a large skull painted on the ground. There was a place on the ground for 6 gems, in which Lomian began to place the gems he had acquired in the slots. Two Aspects of Vecna appeared and began making things difficult. While Lomian was placing the gems, one Aspect got in a killing blow and put Lomian down. The heroes were not phased though, they still had Three and knew he was talented in ritual casting. A few minutes later, Three fell and it was up to Stelian, Shadow, and Aeitius to finish the job. Once the Aspects were dead, the three remaining members gathered up all they needed. Stelian and Aeitius grabbed armor and potions, while Shadow grabbed Ruinblade from Three’s limp hand. Once all of the gems were placed, a portal shot from the ground, and the weakened party was ready to step forth. Once inside the portal, they could see a large figure, constructed out of many dead gods’ flesh. The mammoth object, then came to life. With no healer and a weakened party, this would be a fight to remember. The battle raged on and eventually Aeitius broke a large power gem over the monster’s head, doing massive damage to the creature. The fight was not over yet. Stelian was then struck by a mighty blow and fell unconscious. Shadow was then knocked down, but though he felt like collapsing, he battled on. Stelian (who was believed to have been finished off) then woke back up, and began to fight again. All three were tired and worn, but then a final leaping blow from Shadow brought the creature to his back. Once the creature was dead, Shadow collapsed with the falling body. The heroes then dragged their fallen companions out of the tomb and back to a safe haven. There Stelian bartered away some of the goods the heroes had left over, then brought Three and Lomian back to life. The party then agreed to split into two, Lomian went back to New Haven, Three, Shadow, Stelian, and Aeitius remained where they were. War is coming.

## Triumph of the Chosen
*2012 July 22*

*Destruction of a demilich and the rescue of an old friend*

### GM Only

As the splintered group left Skull City and approached the tomb for a final time a chilling cackle pierced the air. This would be the final confrontation with Acerak, ending with either his death, or theirs. Though Acerak made his best attempts at fooling the party he was unable to drive them away and was forced into direct confrontation. Through teamwork and near misses the Chosen were able to outwit and over power Acerak. Though the battle was not without its losses. In the midst of battle Stelian was caught flat footed by a dangerous blast from Acerak and his soul was stolen. As his body crumbled to ash the Chosen, with renewed vigor, finished Acerak and salvaged the crystal containing the souls of both Stelian, and a lone adventurer named Benn. Leaving the tomb, a storm front came forth and from inside, a floating fortress descended to land on Skull Island. Iltana emerged from inside and presented the Chosen with their new transport and home known as the Sky Citadel. The Chosen destroyed all remaining evidence of Skull Island being home to the Tomb of Horrors, and recruited the remaining denizens of Skull City to come with them. Taking the Sky Citadel to the Astral Sea, the Chosen visited their deities and received gifts and Aetius, finding his true calling, joined the ranks of Haramathur’s followers. 
Upon returning to the Sky Citadel, the Chosen found the whereabouts of their old ally Vengeance and immediately set off to rescue him. Entering the Nine Hells and crashing their small airship in a fast paced air battle, the Chosen located Vengeance being led in chains to an altar. Rousing him with a word of prayer and enlightenment from Three, as well as the feel of cold steel in his hands, Vengeance entered the fray and took his revenge on the devil that had kept him bound all this time. Summoning a quick planar portal, the Chosen escaped the Nine Hells and returned to Sky Citadel to plan their next move.

Hawksworth Prawn & Greeting by Graster
As you descend near Hawksworth Prawn, you notice a large army camped on the rolling hills of the Misty Kingdom. They are near the city of Asalia. The castle there glows with a strange purple light that fills the city. An uneasiness sets in like you’ve never felt before.
The PCs arrive just outside of Hawksworth Prawn. This bustling city smells of the sea and you can hear bells going off near the docks every few minutes. Graster greets the PCs as he recognizes Vengeance. Graster has tracked Baurus and knows he is seeking a “threat”. He also knows that Baurus got a bit of info on the Sword Collector and is most likely stopping there on his way. He knows a shorter way but needs some supplies first.

Rendar Sees Three
Rendar greets Three. He is busy loading up for a blockade against the Dauntless, a pleasure barge rife with crime and illegal gambling operations. He is a member of the Scale of Justice. They plan to cleanse the Misty Kingdom of this evil presence (The Rising Fall) before attacking it directly at its source (Maetrage). He plans to meet up with the others later on if they request it. They may be able to “mutually benefit” from one another.

The Ritual
The PCs spend 135gp on alchemical regents such as sea salts and extract from a blue dragon’s blood as well as rare herbs like sea weed harvested during a full moon. This allows Three to perform the water breathing ritual scroll that Graster has on him. 
Arcana or Nature:

## The End is Here
*2017 August 27*

*Ending an Epic Campaign*

### Setting the Scene
Baurus, Vengeance, Aeitius and Silmarien had traveled to Brightkeep in search of the mysterious Starfire. He was building a device known as the Gaze and its power would rival that of the gods. They had to stop him.

Once inside the Feywild academy, they found him in a room with the device. He spoke, “We finally meet.” Then in a flash of light, they all vanished.

### The Astral Ship
You’re surrounded by stars. A black void with billions of small lights flickering around you. You are alone in the silence. A small whisper to your left. A mother, reassuring her child that everything will be fine. Another whisper behind you. Something about the God’s Chosen. The protectors. A whisper above you. Nothing can undo what he has put in motion.

Moments later, the distant stars coalesce and come together, painting a picture of the Astral Sea. A ship is beneath your feet. The mysterious eladrin stands at the front of the ship next to his device, a field of energy surrounds him as he begins chanting.

Flanking ships near and githyanki pirates descend onto your ship, positioning themselves between you and the field of energy. Roll initiative.

Silmarien destroys a number of githyanki with a blast of fire. The others begin damaging the shield barrier that is protecting Starfire and the Gaze. Moments later, he looks at them angrily and fires the Gaze directly at them. They vanish in white light and become weightless.

### Halls of Creation
Three, Shadow, and Chigaru find themselves walking through a marble palace, seemingly made of stars.

You walk thru the Halls of Creation. You can see through paintings the history of a world known as Prime. You see the Fold and the distant island of Aer among others. The Darkness came in the beginning. A dying universe. Oberyths. The Overgod. Two things lost to time. Although Chigaru has fragments of these memories.

Tapestries along the walls paint pictures of the world as it is. In one, a city deep within the Realm of the Vines displays pictures of horror and destruction. Another, a floating citadel over a field of Tors – an army rebuilding a fallen fortress. A third, displays pure darkness. A feeling you just left. These are portals into the world.

The third portal leads to the Depth of Worlds – the darkest place in the universe where these heroes just defeated Orcus. Three knows that without sealing this doorway, they will need to return often to prevent something horrible from coming through. He only knows one way to seal it, as Haramathur did before him. He received divine insight that he could go on living, should he attempt to give himself over to seal it.

Three prepared the ritual, said goodbye to his friends, and knelt before the tapestry. He laid his blade and holy symbol on the floor in front of him. As he gave himself to seal the Depth of Worlds, Haramathur intervened, giving his remaining half to seal it instead. “Watch over our people,” were the gods last words. The presence of Haramathur disappeared and Three ascended to godhood to take his place in the heavens.

Shortly after, the others prayed to Three for divine guidance in helping the people in the first tapestry. In a flash of lightning, a sword slammed into the ground. Three send justice to them and One came to be around the sword. They all chose the portal to the Realm of the Vines.

### The Tomb of Horrors
Starfire’s chanting stops. He turns, eyes angry. The device turns with him and a sudden blinding light is unleashed in your direction. All goes dark and weightless.

You see an island. A cold, desolate tomb that chills you to the bone. You can almost feel the cold. A hopeless feeling rises within you as your senses come to. You and your allies are no longer weightless. The vision has stopped. The tomb remains. You have returned to your worst nightmare.

The party has four rounds (as a d4 acts as the timer) to find their way out of this room in the Tomb of Horrors before this timeline ceases to exist and they all die with it. Baurus is excited to be traversing a dungeon again and quickly finds hidden panels leading to their exit.

### The Astral Ship Part 2
They are teleported back to the ship from the Tomb of Horrors. Githyanki swarm it now. The party fights their way through them and continues damaging the shield. Baurus wants to take the ship down after witnessing the power of the Gaze. He destroys one wing of the ships and it begins to veer to the right. Then they are teleported again by the Gaze.

### The Tomb of Horrors part 2
They return to a chapel in the tomb. After triggering a few traps and taking damage, Vengeance finds the way out.

### The Astral Ship Part 3
Back on the ship, githyanki swarm once again. Ships are now descending on them. Hundreds of githyanki poised to board the ship. Suddenly, the ships around them come under fire and one is taken out completely. The Transcursus blazes past them and a voice inside their heads says, “Focus on him, gents. I’ve got the rest.” The party knows then that Jinroy the Mindsinger has come to the rescue.

Silmarien uses a spell called Crack the World to split the ship in two. They begin to go down. But it appears Starfire still has some control over where its headed.

### The Tarrasque
“I need more time. I’m so sorry for bringing us here. But I need more time.” Only then do you realize how low the ship is flying. As the ship descends below the trees, you see buildings and towers. Then a crash. You’re thrown to the deck, hanging on as the ship comes to stop. Stones and chunks of marble fall all around you. Within seconds, all is still and quiet. And then screams fill your ears as you notice the terrified citizens running about. Some buildings have been flattened and others are on fire. Pure chaos. Then you hear it…"

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hBVnIQqI18

A world-shattering roar sends your head spinning. Immediately, a gust of wind hits you and dust flies up. You see the shockwave continue into the forest, evaporating trees in its wake.

As you turn, your heart sinks.

At this point, using Fate-style zones, the party fights the Tarrasque. Baurus sets fire to a warehouse to get the beast’s attention. Then proceeds to climb the beast. Vengeance gets to the battlements and positions a ballista, where he begins firing. Once he has the beast’s attention, it comes for him. Aeitius puts up a wall between them, buying the crew more time. Meanwhile, Silmarien helps Starfire rebuild the machine to the point they can use it against the Tarrasque.

A few rounds later, the Gaze fires, tearing thru the beast’s shoulder and dealing significant damage. Silmarien uses Crack the World again, underneath the beast. He sends his griffon to pick up Baurus just in time. The Tarrasque appears to have a hold and won’t fall into the chasm but Baurus delivers a critical hit, reducing its HP to 0 and it slides back into the earth for another long slumber.

The party learns that One, Chigaru, and Shadow got here just in time to evacuate most of the city.

They turn to Starfire, who looks utterly defeated.

A shooting star streaks the night sky. Starfire’s eyes light up in sudden terror, “It’s no star, it’s the worldbreaker, Iosphael. The Gaze can still defeat him. Without it, he will consume our world. Allow me to fire it. One. Last. Time.”

The party agrees, as long as its destroyed after. They rebuild it. Starfire takes off his ring, stars wreathed in flame, and tosses it into the chasm behind the Tarrasque. “It is done. Your victory. My failure. I am Starfire no more.”

They fire the device into the night sky. A horrifying scream echoes across the sky and a ripple is sent out with it. Light consumes them all.
