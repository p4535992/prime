      <title>The End is Here</title>
      <published>2017-08-27T07:31:01-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">h1. Setting the Scene

[[:boris | Baurus]], [[:vengeance | Vengeance]], [[:aietius | Aeitius]] and [[:silmarien | Silmarien]] had traveled to [[Brightkeep | Brightkeep]] in search of the mysterious [[:starfire | Starfire]]. He was building a device known as the Gaze and its power would rival that of the gods. They had to stop him.

Once inside the Feywild academy, they found him in a room with the device. He spoke, "We finally meet." Then in a flash of light, they all vanished. 

h1. The Astral Ship

_You're surrounded by stars. A black void with billions of small lights flickering around you. You are alone in the silence. A small whisper to your left. A mother, reassuring her child that everything will be fine. Another whisper behind you. Something about the God's Chosen. The protectors. A whisper above you. Nothing can undo what he has put in motion._

_Moments later, the distant stars coalesce and come together, painting a picture of the Astral Sea. A ship is beneath your feet. The mysterious eladrin stands at the front of the ship next to his device, a field of energy surrounds him as he begins chanting._

_Flanking ships near and githyanki pirates descend onto your ship, positioning themselves between you and the field of energy. Roll initiative._

[[:silmarien | Silmarien]] destroys a number of githyanki with a blast of fire. The others begin damaging the shield barrier that is protecting [[:starfire | Starfire]] and the Gaze. Moments later, he looks at them angrily and fires the Gaze directly at them. They vanish in white light and become weightless.

h1. Halls of Creation

[[:three | Three]], [[:shadow | Shadow]], and [[:chigaru | Chigaru]] find themselves walking through a marble palace, seemingly made of stars.

_You walk thru the Halls of Creation. You can see through paintings the history of a world known as Prime. You see the Fold and the distant island of Aer among others. The Darkness came in the beginning. A dying universe. Oberyths. The Overgod. Two things lost to time. Although Chigaru has fragments of these memories._

_Tapestries along the walls paint pictures of the world as it is. In one, a city deep within the Realm of the Vines displays pictures of horror and destruction. Another, a floating citadel over a field of Tors - an army rebuilding a fallen fortress. A third, displays pure darkness. A feeling you just left. These are portals into the world._

The third portal leads to the Depth of Worlds - the darkest place in the universe where these heroes just defeated Orcus. [[:three | Three]] knows that without sealing this doorway, they will need to return often to prevent something horrible from coming through. He only knows one way to seal it, as Haramathur did before him. He received divine insight that he could go on living, should he attempt to give himself over to seal it.

Three prepared the ritual, said goodbye to his friends, and knelt before the tapestry. He laid his blade and holy symbol on the floor in front of him. As he gave himself to seal the Depth of Worlds, Haramathur intervened, giving his remaining half to seal it instead. "Watch over our people," were the gods last words. The presence of Haramathur disappeared and Three ascended to godhood to take his place in the heavens. 

Shortly after, the others prayed to Three for divine guidance in helping the people in the first tapestry. In a flash of lightning, a sword slammed into the ground. Three send justice to them and [[:one | One]] came to be around the sword. They all chose the portal to the Realm of the Vines.

h1. The Tomb of Horrors

_Starfire's chanting stops. He turns, eyes angry. The device turns with him and a sudden blinding light is unleashed in your direction. All goes dark and weightless._

_You see an island. A cold, desolate tomb that chills you to the bone. You can almost feel the cold. A hopeless feeling rises within you as your senses come to. You and your allies are no longer weightless. The vision has stopped. The tomb remains. You have returned to your worst nightmare._

The party has four rounds (as a d4 acts as the timer) to find their way out of this room in the Tomb of Horrors before this timeline ceases to exist and they all die with it. Baurus is excited to be traversing a dungeon again and quickly finds hidden panels leading to their exit.

h1. The Astral Ship Part 2

They are teleported back to the ship from the Tomb of Horrors. Githyanki swarm it now. The party fights their way through them and continues damaging the shield. Baurus wants to take the ship down after witnessing the power of the Gaze. He destroys one wing of the ships and it begins to veer to the right. Then they are teleported again by the Gaze.

h1. The Tomb of Horrors part 2

They return to a chapel in the tomb. After triggering a few traps and taking damage, Vengeance finds the way out.

h1. The Astral Ship Part 3

Back on the ship, githyanki swarm once again. Ships are now descending on them. Hundreds of githyanki poised to board the ship. Suddenly, the ships around them come under fire and one is taken out completely. The _Transcursus_ blazes past them and a voice inside their heads says, "Focus on him, gents. I've got the rest." The party knows then that [[:jinroy-the-mindsinger | Jinroy the Mindsinger]] has come to the rescue. 

[[:silmarien | Silmarien]] uses a spell called _Crack the World_ to split the ship in two. They begin to go down. But it appears [[:starfire | Starfire]] still has some control over where its headed.

h1. The Tarrasque

_"I need more time. I'm so sorry for bringing us here. But I need more time." Only then do you realize how low the ship is flying. As the ship descends below the trees, you see buildings and towers. Then a crash. You're thrown to the deck, hanging on as the ship comes to stop. Stones and chunks of marble fall all around you. Within seconds, all is still and quiet. And then screams fill your ears as you notice the terrified citizens running about. Some buildings have been flattened and others are on fire. Pure chaos. Then you hear it..."_

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hBVnIQqI18

_A world-shattering roar sends your head spinning. Immediately, a gust of wind hits you and dust flies up. You see the shockwave continue into the forest, evaporating trees in its wake._
 
_As you turn, your heart sinks._

At this point, using Fate-style zones, the party fights the Tarrasque. [[:boris | Baurus]] sets fire to a warehouse to get the beast's attention. Then proceeds to climb the beast. [[:vengeance | Vengeance]] gets to the battlements and positions a ballista, where he begins firing. Once he has the beast's attention, it comes for him. [[:aietius | Aeitius]] puts up a wall between them, buying the crew more time. Meanwhile, [[:silmarien | Silmarien]] helps [[:starfire | Starfire]] rebuild the machine to the point they can use it against the Tarrasque.

A few rounds later, the Gaze fires, tearing thru the beast's shoulder and dealing significant damage. Silmarien uses _Crack the World_ again, underneath the beast. He sends his griffon to pick up [[:boris | Baurus]] just in time. The Tarrasque appears to have a hold and won't fall into the chasm but Baurus delivers a critical hit, reducing its HP to 0 and it slides back into the earth for another long slumber.

The party learns that [[:one | One]], [[:chigaru | Chigaru]], and [[:shadow | Shadow]] got here just in time to evacuate most of the city. 

They turn to [[:starfire | Starfire]], who looks utterly defeated. 

_A shooting star streaks the night sky. Starfire's eyes light up in sudden terror, "It's no star, it's the worldbreaker, Iosphael. The Gaze can still defeat him. Without it, he will consume our world. Allow me to fire it. One. Last. Time."_

The party agrees, as long as its destroyed after. They rebuild it. Starfire takes off his ring, stars wreathed in flame, and tosses it into the chasm behind the Tarrasque. "It is done. Your victory. My failure. I am Starfire no more." 

They fire the device into the night sky. A horrifying scream echoes across the sky and a ripple is sent out with it. Light consumes them all.

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">h3. Recently in the campaign...

* The PCs head to the Misty Kingdom to halt a barbarian invasion
* The PCs stumble into the lair of Ansis and defeat him
* Gauthak slays the king of the tribe and takes control as the new barbarian ruler
* The PCs find mind-flayers in the castle of Asalia 
* Lomian and Astrid are taken prisoner
* Gauthak's brains are feasted upon

h3. Key NPCs

*Quinn* - a human adventurer
*Saulthak* - a barbarian shaman
*Yahlrisik-Ul* - a mind-flayer mastermind
*Aertis El-Kahn* - a drow assassin, for the Rising Fall

h3. Planned Events 

_Jinroy meets up with Gauthak_
Jinroy's ship is flagged down by the Kinn-Su warriors and Jinroy is brought to their king.  He learns that this is Gauthak.  
_Echoes from the Song of Heroes_
A song echoes throughout this region of the Underdark, igniting the passion and souls of Lomian and Astrid.  They hear the calling and begin their journey towards the light.  A skill challenge is enabled as they fight their way out of the pit of caves.  
_Reunited_
The groups find each other and the time has come to decide whether they escape this horrible place or travel deeper in an attempt to kill the elder brain.
_Aertis El-Kahn_
Along their escape route, the PCs encounter the stealthy assassin and fight for their lives.  "The darkness surrounds you, accept your fate and Fall!"  A flaming torch comes from the darkness and spooks the drow as it blinds them.  Widgeon holds the torch as he steps forth.  Aertis kills his last ally and escapes as the mind-flayers move in yet leaves a stern warning, "Run fest and know it won't be fest enough."  Jinroy recognizes the robes and pendant as a sign of the Thieves Guild in Maetrage.  They work directly with the Rising Fall.  
_Crippling the Elder Brain_
The PCs encounter mind-flayers at the gates to a large chamber.  After they defeat them, the PCs can enter the citadel and navigate to find the elder brain.  They discover a locked room with stone doors.  Inside, they find their equipment (minus a few items).  As they find the elder brain, they are approached by dozens of mind-flayers.  When all hope seems lost, the mind-flayers attention snaps towards a buzzing sound and scream.  Almost all the flayers leave immediately to engage the new threat (the God's Chosen).  After Widgeon defeats the brain, he leads PCs down a corridor to King Heroldi.  
_Escort Heroldi &amp; Thonan back to the Castle_
Thonan is able to navigate once he is healed or fed.  The PCs will need to defend him against various terrors of the Underdark.  


h2. Session Details

*Emotional Effects in the Underdark*
# Brief flashes of paranoia
# Moments of deja vu that continually imply that the memory being reexperienced will end in terror or pain.
# The taste and scent of foul mud, randomly overwhelming all other tastes and smells
# Echoes of some sounds, but not others, as if nearby sounds were traveling through entirely different spaces to reach you.
# Tricks of the light that make faces and other distinguishing characteristics briefly unrecognizable.
# You can hear a deep rumbling sound throughout the caverns around you, as if something is being disturbed.  

*Song of Heroes Skill Challenge/Escape the Illithid Holding*
_8 Successes before 3 Failures_
Primary (Maximum 3 Times)
* Acrobatics DC 24 - you dodge between illithids or vault over them
* Athletics DC 24 - you slay or stun an illithid allowing you to pass
* Dungeoneering DC 29 - you know enough about the area to discover a side tunnel allowing an advantage
* Stealth DC 24/29 - you slip into the shadows and past an invading illithid

Secondary (Maximum 1 time each)
* Endurance DC 24 - your resolve and endurance allows you to strike or vault with full force (+2 to acrobatics/athletics)
* Perception DC 16 - you spot an area to hide in (+2 to stealth)
+2 to all checks from the Song of Heroes

Failure on a check = lose 20 hit points and a healing surge
Failure on the challenge = lose 50 hit points and 2 healing surges

They work directly with the Rising Fall.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Crippling the Elder Brain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The PCs encounter mind-flayers at the gates to a large chamber.  After they defeat them, the PCs can enter the citadel and navigate to find the elder brain.  They discover a locked room with stone doors.  Inside, they find their equipment (minus a few items).  As they find the elder brain, they are approached by dozens of mind-flayers.  When all hope seems lost, the mind-flayers attention snaps towards a buzzing sound and scream.  Almost all the flayers leave immediately to engage the new threat (the God&amp;#8217;s Chosen).  After Widgeon defeats the brain, he leads PCs down a corridor to King Heroldi.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Escort Heroldi &amp;amp; Thonan back to the Castle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thonan is able to navigate once he is healed or fed.  The PCs will need to defend him against various terrors of the Underdark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Session Details&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional Effects in the Underdark&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Brief flashes of paranoia&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Moments of deja vu that continually imply that the memory being reexperienced will end in terror or pain.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The taste and scent of foul mud, randomly overwhelming all other tastes and smells&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Echoes of some sounds, but not others, as if nearby sounds were traveling through entirely different spaces to reach you.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tricks of the light that make faces and other distinguishing characteristics briefly unrecognizable.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;You can hear a deep rumbling sound throughout the caverns around you, as if something is being disturbed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Song of Heroes Skill Challenge/Escape the Illithid Holding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;8 Successes before 3 Failures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Primary (Maximum 3 Times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acrobatics DC 24 &amp;#8211; you dodge between illithids or vault over them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Athletics DC 24 &amp;#8211; you slay or stun an illithid allowing you to pass&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dungeoneering DC 29 &amp;#8211; you know enough about the area to discover a side tunnel allowing an advantage&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Stealth DC 24/29 &amp;#8211; you slip into the shadows and past an invading illithid&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondary (Maximum 1 time each)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Endurance DC 24 &amp;#8211; your resolve and endurance allows you to strike or vault with full force (+2 to acrobatics/athletics)&lt;/li&gt;

+2 to all checks from the Song of Heroes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Failure on the challenge = lose 50 hit points and 2 healing surges&lt;/p&gt;

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">h4. Hawksworth Prawn &amp; Greeting by Graster

_As you descend near Hawksworth Prawn, you notice a large army camped on the rolling hills of the Misty Kingdom.  They are near the city of Asalia.  The castle there glows with a strange purple light that fills the city.  An uneasiness sets in like you've never felt before._
The PCs arrive just outside of Hawksworth Prawn.  _This bustling city smells of the sea and you can hear bells going off near the docks every few minutes._  Graster greets the PCs as he recognizes Vengeance.  Graster has tracked Baurus and knows he is seeking a "threat".  He also knows that Baurus got a bit of info on the Sword Collector and is most likely stopping there on his way.  He knows a shorter way but needs some supplies first.  

h4. Rendar Sees Three

Rendar greets Three.  He is busy loading up for a blockade against the Dauntless, a pleasure barge rife with crime and illegal gambling operations.  He is a member of the Scale of Justice.  They plan to cleanse the Misty Kingdom of this evil presence (The Rising Fall) before attacking it directly at its source (Maetrage).  He plans to meet up with the others later on if they request it.  They may be able to "mutually benefit" from one another.

h4. The Ritual 

_The PCs spend 135gp on alchemical regents such as sea salts and extract from a blue dragon's blood as well as rare herbs like sea weed harvested during a full moon._  This allows Three to perform the water breathing ritual scroll that Graster has on him.  
*Arcana or Nature:*
*Under 14 = 1 hour*
*15-19 = 2 hours* 
*20-24 = 4 hours*
*25-29 = 8 hours*
*30+ = 24 hours*

*_Refer to Wizards pdf_*

Baurus is unconscious in the back of the cavern, hidden behind a mushroom patch.  Once healed, Baurus awakens and asks about the treasure or leads the PCs to the treasure.  
*12,480 XP for 2 encounters if all survive...*
*Roleplaying XP

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Our heroes found themselves in the dark area they had previously explored.  This time they could feel the end of this horror draw near.  They first came across a room with an odd man from the Fae, he was interested in playing a game.  The heroes easily defeated the man in the game (due to some slight cheating) and the man became very angry.  A battle broke out and after the heroes began to win, the man disappeared (assumedly back to the Fae.)  The God’s Chosen carried on and found themselves in a frightening room with a large skull painted on the ground.  There was a place on the ground for 6 gems, in which Lomian began to place the gems he had acquired in the slots.  Two Aspects of Vecna appeared and began making things difficult.  While Lomian was placing the gems, one Aspect got in a killing blow and put Lomian down.  The heroes were not phased though, they still had Three and knew he was talented in ritual casting.  A few minutes later, Three fell and it was up to Stelian, Shadow, and Aeitius to finish the job.  Once the Aspects were dead, the three remaining members gathered up all they needed.  Stelian and Aeitius grabbed armor and potions, while Shadow grabbed Ruinblade from Three’s limp hand.  Once all of the gems were placed, a portal shot from the ground, and the weakened party was ready to step forth.  Once inside the portal, they could see a large figure, constructed out of many dead gods’ flesh.  The mammoth object, then came to life.  With no healer and a weakened party, this would be a fight to remember.  The battle raged on and eventually Aeitius broke a large power gem over the monster’s head, doing massive damage to the creature.  The fight was not over yet.  Stelian was then struck by a mighty blow and fell unconscious.  Shadow was then knocked down, but though he felt like collapsing, he battled on.  Stelian (who was believed to have been finished off) then woke back up, and began to fight again.  All three were tired and worn, but then a final leaping blow from Shadow brought the creature to his back.  Once the creature was dead, Shadow collapsed with the falling body.  The heroes then dragged their fallen companions out of the tomb and back to a safe haven.  There Stelian bartered away some of the goods the heroes had left over, then brought Three and Lomian back to life.  The party then agreed to split into two, Lomian went back to New Haven, Three, Shadow, Stelian, and Aeitius remained where they were.  War is coming.</content>

      <title>Aspects of Evil</title>
      <published>2012-06-03T01:35:00-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">     While our heroes continue their adventure, they find themselves back in the room in which they previously left off.  While some of the party prays to the pool and the God it represents, Lomian finds two gems wrapped around a vampire’s neck.  As Lomian a-tunes the gems, the rest of the party looks about the area.  After much thought, the party returns to the previous room they were in and decide to go through a different portal than the first time.  The room they arrive in has many dead bodies and constructs.  The constructs come to life and attack the heroes.  While the battle rages, a familiar face comes stumbling out of the portal behind our heroes, the blind companion known as Aetius has returned.  Relieved to see their friend, the heroes were whole again.  Once the final enemy had met his match, the Gods’ Chosen began to search the room.  Weapons, armor, and a blood-colored symbol occupied the room.  The symbol represented Kord’s brother, Tuern, who was slain in the past by Kord’s evil brother.  Another gem was also found and Lomian a-tunes it and puts it on his belt.  The heroes then elect for Ginroy to step through a swirling portal, he describes to the rest of the party what he sees.  He describes a demon, followers, and a purple gem.  The party decides to try a bit of a long shot attack.  The party decides on shooting magic through the portal to get the upper hand on the demons.  As soon as the first shot is fired, the portal closes, and Ginroy is on his own.  The party quickly tries to re-open the portal.  Seeing that the portal cannot be opened again, the party frantically tries another portal.  They eventually meet up with Ginroy (who has been talking his way out of an early grave) and are prepared to defend their friend.   In the room, a giant tentacled monster rises from the pool in the middle during the battle, the true battle had just begun.  The Aspect of Vector also made an appearance, but was overcome by The Gods’ Chosen.  After the battle, the heroes searched through more portals and found their way back to the Shadowfell.  After a small encounter with some unfriendly ghosts, the heroes found their way back to the tapestry room they had previously passed through.  The tapestries depicted pictures of Demogorgon and Orcus.  While searching the chamber, aspects of both Demogorgon and Orcus appear before the party and begin their assault.  After a display of acrobatics and power, Stellion brought down Demogorgon in two final blows.  After trading blows with the aspect of Orcus, Gahthak eventually severs Orcus into two.  The Gods’ Chosen returned to the room they began in and rested.  The end of this nightmare felt the nearest it had ever felt.</content>

      <title>The Wizard's Crystal</title>
      <published>2012-03-26T08:00:00-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Upon arriving in the Astral Sea, the party suddenly hears a scuffle happening on the deck of the pirate ship they occupy. Coming up to the deck, the party sees the pirates that had been manning their ship slain by a small group of black cloaked strangers. The strangers lead the party to a man who had taken over the duty of flying the ship. When asked of his intentions by Three, the man explained where they were headed and stated that soon they would "understand everything". Soon the ship docked and the party was taken to a fortress built into a mountain where the Shardmind Ilnedra was waiting. She explained that though the party had undertaken many quests, all were secondary to slowing the progress of Starfire, who was working in the Astral Sea at present, collecting artifacts and acting as the de facto servant of the goddess Erathis. However it was believed that his servitude was more out of convenience of gaining power and resources rather than for the greater good. The party was then sent to the island of 1,000 spires to find the next artifact of importance to Starfire, a crystal that once belonged to a great and terrible wizard. After hours of searching they found the spire belonging to the wizard and entered to search for the crystal. The party then began collecting gems within the spire, falling prey to the traps that each of the gems required to collect them, as well as battles with the servants of the evil god Bane, and devils as well. Once the gems were collected and used to unlock the magic seal on the wizard's crystal the party was teleported to the top and forced to battle the newly freed wizard who owned the crystal and had been sealed for the good of the people living on the island. After a brief but nearly costly battle the party vanquished the wizard causing an explosion that forced them all off the spire to the ground far below. As the party raced to regroup and help the badly injured Three, several Mind Flayer's appeared and immediately attacked the group. When all seemed lost, a huge axe flew forth from the blowing sand and cleaved the largest Mind Flayer in half. When the two others fled, Baurus stepped forward and introduced himself to the shocked party.  </content>

      <title>Welcome to the Astral Sea</title>

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">[[Ashfilar]].  The Land of 1000 Spires.  Before it lies the city of [[Regalhier]].  The stone-walled city rests between two mountains and grants the only access to Ashfilar from the south.  A divine energy once surged here.  All 1027 spires once united in channeling the most powerful forces this side of the Astral Sea.  A famous dungeon, Alshanir, lies underneath the central spire.  The Sorcerer of Alshanir is one of the most-famed legends in the history of the Astral Sea.  He holds a crystal that is to be sought for great power.  

The central chamber is covered in long-forgotten runes and glyphs that shed light no more.  A lone crystal sits on a pedestal in the middle of the room.  The PCs must gather all the gems from surrounding rooms to deactivate the ward protecting the crystal.  Once the ward is gone, the crystal shatters creating an explosion leaving the PCs prone and dazed.  The Sorcerer of Alshanir has been set free...

4 rooms require challenges in order to collect the sacred gems.  "Your soul be damned before the crystal you shall take.  Find the lost gems and a friend you might make."

*Black Gem* 
-The PC who grabs it will slow time and see black flames on everything as it moves in slow motion.  Every round the PC takes 40 points of damage.  Round 2: weapon disappears.  Round 3: Curse of Black Flame (Ongoing 20 damage).  Round 4: Dazed, save ends.  Round 5: Lose half speed.
*Purple Gem* (in the final room)  (only escape is to attack an ally)  *Escape is only an attack away...do what you would not*
-The PCs are separated and think they are in the room with 1 ally.  This is not the case.  It's a visual trick and they are being attacked by these deceptions.  Each deception has HP equal to its PCs bloodied value.  Once a deception is destroyed the PC is teleported to the gem.
*Green Gem* (hiding underneath the floor)  (hear it by tapping)
-Banesworn in the laboratory.  Potions cause terribly dangerous environment.  
*Red Gem* (hiding in the head of a suit of armor)

      <content gm_only="true" format="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/campaign/quest-for-starfire/wikis/Ashfilar/new" class="create-wiki-page-link"&gt;Ashfilar&lt;/a&gt;.  The Land of 1000 Spires.  Before it lies the city of &lt;a href="/campaign/quest-for-starfire/wikis/Regalhier/new" class="create-wiki-page-link"&gt;Regalhier&lt;/a&gt;.  The stone-walled city rests between two mountains and grants the only access to Ashfilar from the south.  A divine energy once surged here.  All 1027 spires once united in channeling the most powerful forces this side of the Astral Sea.  A famous dungeon, Alshanir, lies underneath the central spire.  The Sorcerer of Alshanir is one of the most-famed legends in the history of the Astral Sea.  He holds a crystal that is to be sought for great power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central chamber is covered in long-forgotten runes and glyphs that shed light no more.  A lone crystal sits on a pedestal in the middle of the room.  The PCs must gather all the gems from surrounding rooms to deactivate the ward protecting the crystal.  Once the ward is gone, the crystal shatters creating an explosion leaving the PCs prone and dazed.  The Sorcerer of Alshanir has been set free&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 rooms require challenges in order to collect the sacred gems.  &amp;#8220;Your soul be damned before the crystal you shall take.  Find the lost gems and a friend you might make.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Black Gem&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
-The PC who grabs it will slow time and see black flames on everything as it moves in slow motion.  Every round the PC takes 40 points of damage.  Round 2: weapon disappears.  Round 3: Curse of Black Flame (Ongoing 20 damage).  Round 4: Dazed, save ends.  Round 5: Lose half speed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Purple Gem&lt;/strong&gt; (in the final room)  (only escape is to attack an ally)  &lt;strong&gt;Escape is only an attack away&amp;#8230;do what you would not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-The PCs are separated and think they are in the room with 1 ally.  This is not the case.  It&amp;#8217;s a visual trick and they are being attacked by these deceptions.  Each deception has HP equal to its PCs bloodied value.  Once a deception is destroyed the PC is teleported to the gem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Green Gem&lt;/strong&gt; (hiding underneath the floor)  (hear it by tapping)&lt;br /&gt;
-Banesworn in the laboratory.  Potions cause terribly dangerous environment.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Red Gem&lt;/strong&gt; (hiding in the head of a suit of armor)&lt;br /&gt;

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">*Greeting at the Mines*
_The street leading to the mine is lined on both sides with rundown buildings that tower up to 4 stories high.  The dim light inside the buildings tips you off that they are still occupied.  What do you do?_
The buildings are almost all homes to miners and/or their families.  A strange glow also comes from deep within the mine.  If the PCs search any homes, they will meet miners familiar with both Larg, the old mine leader, and the Rising Fall.  

_As you approach the entrance, a door in the building nearest it opens.  Two dwarves, two humans, and a female elf step out and block the entrance to the mine.  They are all dressed in black cloaks with a red symbol on their gloves._  Insight DC 27 alerts them that the symbol represents the Rising Fall.

The elf speaks, _"I am Faelis.  A representative of the Fall.  What is your business here?_
Faelis will not allow the PCs into the mines as she already knows their business.  She will either kill them or send them to jail.  The Rising Fall sent her on a suicide mission to slow the PCs.  This band carries nothing on them of value.  

*Within the Deepening Stalls*
_The first level of the mines looks eerily similar to the entrance.  Rundown buildings line the cave walls and three tunnels branch off from the chamber.  The two tunnels on the sides appear normal yet the central tunnel entrance is adorned with stones and writings in a strange language.  It is also the only tunnel that has been collapsed._  The central tunnel is mined by dwarves.  The others are mined by everyone else.  All tunnels will eventually get the PCs to the Deepest Stall. They will find the treasure and see less detailed workings.  _Realizing that time is against you, you decide that whichever path you take, you will take it to the end.  There is no time to backtrack._

_You travel deeper into the earth, level by level, realizing that as you descend, the buildings and structures slowly become more appealing.  The structures you begin to see are no longer ruins but in fact newer, more aesthetically pleasing buildings.  After a few hours, you reach a corridor that descends into darkness._  Refer to random dungeon.


_This chamber is covered in treasures.  Gold and jewels spill from chests scattered about the room.  A lone dwarf stands over a furnace resembling a forge.  A large sword with strange writings glows red and sits on the edge of the forge.  Without even turning around, the dwarf speaks, "Workers are to remain at work or return to their quarters.  Being here, ye deny them both.  Ye better have a damned good excuse ready."  The dwarf lifts a warhammer from a nearby table._  Larg is forging the Blade of Elemental Chaos for Elkantar.  He is in no mood to talk and when the PCs mention the Rising Fall OR Starfire he attacks.  Two elite dwarf guards join him from an adjoining room along with any that the PCs missed along the way.  After the first round of battle, the fire drake enters from his chamber.  

_Larg lowers on one knee and raises a hand, "Stop!  Starfire is at Castle Maelok with Elkantar Mal'Een as we speak.  The lift over there leads directly into the Castle Forge.  It'll have you there in minutes._  If the PCs leave the dwarf, he will hurl his warhammer with deadly accuracy at one of them from behind and rush in.  He will not let them leave without a fight and he will not go with them.  The PCs will either remember the Blade or it will call to them.  Near it, in the flames is a piece of charred paper.  It is a letter from Baurus.
Treasure in this room includes: 700 pp, Blade of Elemental Chaos, two potions of vitality, lvl 20 Jarring Hammer

*Castle Maelok*
_You arrive in a small room lit only by the fires of a forge.  A lone dwarf is working a piece of metal into a sword.  He jumps when he sees you and draws his axe._  This dwarf is Ironhewe.  He is of good alignment and a prisoner of the Rising Fall.  The forge is actually locked.  If the PCs can help him escape, he can take them directly to the throne room.

_The halls of Castle Maelok are extremely quiet and empty.  Your footsteps create a slight echo against the marble floors.  You arrive at the doors to the throne room and you can hear voices on the other side._  A sudden scream of anger rises from the room with a flash of great light.  The sound of glass shattering follows.  When the PCs go in they see a large broken window behind the throne.  _A drow stands in the middle of the group of soldiers and points in your direction, "Kill them!  They're with him!"  A fresh stream of blood falls from a newly made scar on his face._

Throughout the fight, Elkantar will shout things such as, "You will pay for what he did!" and "Wretched followers!  Your master will see you in the nine hells!"  If questioned while alone, Elkantar Mal'Een will reveal that Starfire stole the Fallen Stone from his very hands.  He offered to pay but Mal'Een refused.  The Fallen Stone can enchant anything beyond imagining.  The amount of magic flowing through it is incredible.  

After the fight the PCs learn that Starfire has fled for the docks.  The Cloak of the Walking wounded is the treasure for this room.  Elkantar wears it.

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">_Recap then read Neal's intro to the Tor_

h3. The Messenger

_You can hear a galloping sound outside of the tor and a man yelling, "Help!  Please Help!"_

_You see a horse lying dead with arrows sticking out from its side.  A man scrambles up the hill towards you, holding out a scroll in one hand.  "Please-" the resounding THUD interrupts his speech as an arrow tip emerges from his chest.  He falls to the ground at your feet and the scroll falls from his hand.  Seven riders approach you on horseback._

"Sorry for the noise, gentlemen.  He's a common thief so if you'll please return that scroll to us we will be on our way."  

*Perception DC 25 - the dead man wears nicer clothes than most thieves*
*Insight DC 25 - the man on horseback does not appear to be very honest*
*History DC 25 - the riders' clothing and armor speak that they hail from Risencrest in the Rising Lands*

The men will dismount and fight if the PCs do not cooperate.  The men will not wait long, either.
*5200 XP 
-Human Blade Noble
-2 Human Snipers
-4 Human Soldier Minions*

h3. Crossing the Rising River

_A wide stone bridge crosses the river ahead of you.  At each end, two towers flank an iron portcullis guarding entrance to the bridge.  Three men stand behind the bars of iron watching you as you approach._

*Perception DC 29 - You notice arrow slits along various portions of the two towers.*
*History DC 25 - This location, known as The Cross, is one of only two bridges across the Rising River.  The other bridge is in Maransa.*

_"Evening, gents.  No passage thru The Cross, I'm afraid.  Queen Marvella has commanded it.  Only her royal guard is allowed through."_

*Skill Challenge Complexity 2, Level 20 - 6 successes before 3 failures, 5600 XP
_Primary_
Diplomacy DC 30 - The players try to convince the guards of their true intentions
Bluff DC 26 - The players lie to gain passage
Intimidate DC 30 - The player uses fear tactics
_Secondary_
History - Use history of The Cross to gain a +2 to next Diplomacy
Perception - Use your keen senses to gain a +2 to any of the checks
Success - The players are granted access.
Failure - The players must cross the river by other means*

*The river is 60 feet across with a strong current towards the sea.  Athletics DC 20 to move your speed minus 1.  The penalty is to stay afloat.  The current pulls you 2 squares to the sea for every 3 you move forward.*

h3. Sneaking Into Risencrest Before Sun-Up

_An vast city lies before you in the dark of night.  Few buildings even have light leading you to believe it must be deep into the night hours.  High stone walls surround the city.  A large gate leads into the city but it is closed._

The only way in is to climb the walls.  *Athletics DC 27 to climb.  Athletics DC 15 to climb with a rope.*

The PCs must stealthily navigate the city walls and get into the castle this way.  Each round for 3 rounds, the players must make a *DC 22 Stealth check* in order to keep hidden and not make noise.  If a player fails, the nearest guards will attack.  The players have 2 rounds to quiet the guards before more show up.  If 3 separate garrisons see them, the players are in a lot of trouble.

-1 Garrison = 7 Human Soldier Minions = 2100 XP

-7000 XP awarded for getting in unnoticed 

_You find a passageway that leads you down into the courtyard of the grand castle just as the first light of day is approaching over the distant hills.  The doors to the castle are open and a woman stands in a cloud of mist.  She looks right at you and begins to laugh.  She points behind you to a man standing in the shadows.  As he emerges, you notice the green fire in his eyes.  Three make a history check.  Sudden dread overcomes you as you recall the name [[:samael | Samael]]...and in a burst of green flame that throws you to the ground, the man transforms into the legendary dragon before your very eyes._

*12,000 XP 
Elder Green Dragon*

When Samael gets down to 150 hit points or less, he takes flight screaming, "Wretched witch!  You're not worth the trouble!  As for you, brave adventurers, you have not seen the last of Samael!"  

h3. Defeating Marvella

_With the dragon slain, you turn your attention to the doors of the castle.  Yet, they do not open._

_The entrance hall to Castle Risencrest is a large open area.  Pillars line both sides and a slight mist hovers above the ground.  A strange form appears in at the far end.  She eyes you with a death glare.  Knights begin to emerge from the darkness._

*8950 XP
Marvella (Mist Hag)
2 Blaspheme Knight Keepers*

If the bodies are searched, the PCs will find Marvella's Crystal Ball.  (lvl 20 Crystal Ball of Spying)  She also has a spellbook with only 1 spell in it.  All the other pages are blank.  "Right here from nothing at all, bring about my fortunes without the crystal ball."  If read aloud, a chest appears and opens with 48,000 gp inside.</content>

      <title>A Death and An Oath</title>
      <published>2011-08-19T10:57:00-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">After days of battling the disease infesting his body Thalion's will finally gave way and he succumbed to the Mummy's Rot. The remaining members of the party remained in the sanctuary of the Skullbreakers as Three sent a message to Quinn and Widgeon hastening their return to the island. Upon their arrival the group returned to the tomb and descended into a recently discovered trapdoor in the floor. Traveling further into the tomb and battling horrors along the way, the party discovers a seemingly harmless room with a jewel adorned skull sitting on a pedestal in the center of it. Quinn took the skull and triggered a trap opening the floor below him into the darkness of the inner temple. The party traveled down into the depths leading to a large circular room. However, as the entered, the cackling wraith of the mad priest Moghadam. Though victory seemed distant for a greater part of the battle, Three made a desperate final strike against the wraith and slew it. As it turned to shadow and disintegrated its magical sword dropped to the ground. Three approached the sword and when he stooped to pick it up, a voice was heard in his head asking if he would swear an oath to see the Demilich Acerak destroyed. Three took up the oath in the name of Haramathur and thus Ruinblade was his. </content>

      <title>The Tomb of Horrors</title>
      <published>2011-08-11T01:44:00-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">The brave party enters the tomb crafted by a mad priest and accolade of the Demilich Acerak, and finds it to be a treacherous labyrinth testing their bodies as well as minds. Each of the encounters in the mazelike Tomb leaves its mark on the adventurers in one way or another. The first being the least taxing, though still leaving the party fatigued and confused. The second encounter took place in a horrible mockery of a burial chamber wherein the party encountered two mummies, and managed to lay three more to rest. However this encounter was not without its dangers, as Thalion was struck a deadly blow by one of the mummies, causing him to contract the mummy's rot plague. The final encounter found the party fighting a bewitched eladrin woman, as well as each other due to a dangerous spell being cast by a hallway coated in runes. After surviving the encounter and helping the save the woman from the mists of madness caused by the runes the party returned to the Skullbreakers' haven. Unfortunately, during the rest that the party took in this place Thalion's condition worsened requiring Quinn and Widgeon to be sent to mainland in an attempt to find a cure. The party's only option now is to return to a newfound passage in the Tomb and pray that help arrives before it is too late for Thalion...</content>

      <published>2011-08-10T20:32:00-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Joined by Quinn the adventurers leave Algoria and Argawane behind once more as they approach the true Tomb of Horrors. They receive word from a contact of Quinn's that their next destination is Skull Island. Upon reaching the beach to set out to the island they are accosted by a gnome who bears the symbol of Algoria. The gnome reveals himself to be a bard, and good friend of the king of Algoria known as Widgeon. Utilizing an enchanted feather found earlier on the quest, the newly expanded group of adventurers set out for Skull Island. Once on the island they head toward a great skull shaped rock in the center of a city. This leads to several encounters with undead as well as the three warring factions on the island. Finally defeated in combat with several powerful warriors, the adventurers find themselves guests of the Skullbreakers, a group of adventurers who have previously braved the Tomb of Horrors and failed in their quests leaving them scarred either mentally or physically. After bestowing upon the party a few gifts, they stand ready to enter the Tomb and face whatever terrors lie inside. </content>

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">h6. Hammerfast

The PCs can gain the knowledge (Streetwise DC 24) that Quinn Morlin usually resides in Nenlast.  
Jarel Hammerthorn can lead them to Nenlast if they agree to guard his caravan along the way. It's about 40 miles from Hammerfast.  It requires a day and a half of travel.  

h6. Journey to Nenlast

The first 10 miles is on the King's Road.  During this part of the journey, a wild storm arises over the road.  A DC 20 Endurance check is required to not lose a healing surge.
As the characters turn north from the King's Road, they are attacked.

XP 5000
3 lvl 15 Orc Mercenaries
4 lvl 16 Ogre Bludeoneers 
The total gold on the orc bodies is 5000gp.

_Shortly after traveling about 10 miles north, you hear a growling and whimpering in the woods to the right of the road._  If the PCs examine, read this: _A wolf, dire wolf by the looks of it, is caught in a claw trap.  It's obvious that poachers are responsible.  The wolf is not dead but in bad shape.  It's caught around his neck and he is bleeding profusely._
If Three chooses to heal the wolf, it becomes slightly attached to him (although not obedient yet).  

h6. Nenlast

_Towards midday, you reach the town of [[Nenlast | Nenlast]].  Nenlast sits on the shores of Lake Nen.  The town is surrounded by high stone walls with a group of guards at the entrance._

h4. Nenlast Sewers

# _The sewers are ankle high in sludge and it often rises to knee high.  Strangely, you notice gargoyles set into the corners of each room.  It looks as if these weren't always just sewers...you can hear splashing noises every few moments from the corridor straight ahead.  The corridor to your left smells strongly of sulfur._
# _Two corridors exit this room.  Two gargoyles have their eyes set upon the third who rests between the two corridors.  He looks to be less perched like the others.  This one...is on guard._
# _This hallway wraps around leading to the same room you just came from._  A Perception DC 24 notices that one entire wall has VERY small cracks all over it.  It could be weak.  Inside this chamber rests the statue of a hero.  An Arcana DC 22 recognizes the magic item, the "stone band" on his finger.
# _Thick clouds of sulfur spurt from the ground every few seconds in this chamber.  The clouds are thick and appear at random._  Refer to Sulfur Spewers Trap.  When the first PC crosses the line in this room, monsters rise from the sludge and sulfur and attack!  This encounter includes: 1 aboleth slime mage, 2 aboleth lashers, and 9 kuo-toa guards.  *This encounter is worth 9950 XP*

_A wooden door sits on the far wall.  Gold hinges and hardware look out of place on this door set in the sewers._

h4. Jaerys Foxstone's Lair

# _This corridor leads to a small set of stairs.  Atop the stairs are two doorways and two guards eyeing you curiously as you enter._  The guards will ask the business of the adventurers.  A skill challenge will allow the adventurers by.  If they reveal a magic item to the guards, they are allowed to enter the door on the right.  "If you can retrieve the magic item from beyond this door, you will be granted an audience with Jaerys Foxstone."  Perception DC 22 notices the gargoyles at the back end.  Perception DC 27 notices the secret door.
# _You descend a staircase about 10 feet into a room dimly lit with torches.  It resembles the sewers and the floor is covered in sewage and sludge to about ankle height.  A lone, stone gargoyle watches over the room from the corner.  Two doors are at the far end._  When two characters have crossed the middle line, the Aboleth Overseer and 8 aboleth servitors arise from the ground.  If anyone enters the corner by the gargoyle, he attacks.  Otherwise he attacks during the 3rd round of combat.  *This encounter is worth 8800 XP*
# When the door has been open for one minute, it suddenly slams shut.  The room is overcome by a magical darkness.  One minute later, the door opens and any characters inside have lost one magic item.
# _This room has a pyramid structure in the middle of it that rises about 15 feet high.  Atop it you can see a bright glowing statue of a phoenix.  A golem steps out of the front stone wall and roars as six cyclops step out from behind the pyramid._  An Athletics DC 25 is required to climb the pyramid on the steep sides.  An Athletics DC 15 is required to climb either stairs.  *This encounter is worth 7400 XP*  Atop the pyramid is the glowing statue of a phoenix wearing a belt.  The belt is the Phoenix Sash.  The guards at the entrance will let the PCs pass if they show this item.
# The two rooms in the hallway lead to empty barracks.  Between the two rooms the PCs can find about 15,000 gp.  _The stairway descends into a large open room.  Six men sit at a table playing dice and toying with strange items you are not familiar with.  There are bookshelves and desks all around the room and hundreds of strange objects and paintings you have never seen before._
"Welcome gentlemen.  And to what do I owe the honor of your company?"
"If you can defeat the great [[:jaerys-foxstone | Jaerys Foxstone]] in combat, I shall indeed lead you to your fellow 'Quinn' friend.  Gentlemen!  Prepare for battle!"
Two human blade nobles, four archers, and Jaerys Foxstone attack!  *This encounter is worth 10,300 XP*

Quinn will give them back their bag of holding along with 5 gems worth 5000 gp each.  He will also give them two gifts.  The Essence of the Scout is the first.  He also offers to inscribe a magical tattoo on someone.  This is the Eager Hero's Tattoo.  Quinn also has a question for the group about a Starfire.  He read a scroll in the bag of holding.  He wishes to help them.  He's still capable of great adventures and tells them his next location so they can send him word when they need his help.



Treasure found during level 16:

&amp;#8220;If you can defeat the great &amp;#8221;/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/jaerys-foxstone&amp;quot; class=&amp;#8220;wiki-content-link&amp;#8221;&amp;gt;Jaerys Foxstone&lt;/a&gt; in combat, I shall indeed lead you to your fellow &amp;#8216;Quinn&amp;#8217; friend.  Gentlemen!  Prepare for battle!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Two human blade nobles, four archers, and Jaerys Foxstone attack!  &lt;strong&gt;This encounter is worth 10,300 XP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quinn will give them back their bag of holding along with 5 gems worth 5000 gp each.  He will also give them two gifts.  The Essence of the Scout is the first.  He also offers to inscribe a magical tattoo on someone.  This is the Eager Hero&amp;#8217;s Tattoo.  Quinn also has a question for the group about a Starfire.  He read a scroll in the bag of holding.  He wishes to help them.  He&amp;#8217;s still capable of great adventures and tells them his next location so they can send him word when they need his help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasure found during level 16:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;lvl 17 Stone Band&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;lvl 18 Phoenix Sash&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;lvl 19 Essence of the Scout&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;lvl 20 Eager Hero&amp;#8217;s Tattoo&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;25,000gp&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;15,000gp&lt;/del&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;5000gp&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <title>Defeating the Tomb of Shadows</title>
      <published>2011-07-26T03:31:00-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">You feel the darkness enclosing around you. Within seconds, all is dark.

You can see your friends are with you in the darkness with the exception of Thalion. Suddenly, there is a flash that cuts through the darkness, temporarily blinding you. When you can see again, your vision is blurred. It appears a long hallway stands before you. Two doors stand on either side.

Door 1 – You can see Brightkeep, in the Feywild. A group of wizards sit around a large table with grim looks upon their faces. You recognize a few of them. Their sadness reaches out to you.

Door 2 – You see an underground dwarven city, trapped between the very planes of existence. The cries of the dwarves strike terror into your soul.

Door 3 – A familiar kingdom lies before your eyes. Algoria. But it looks nothing like it did. Flames engulf the countryside and cities are in ruins. You can hear the cries of women and children.

Door 4 – You can see Greyhawk. Suddenly, a large army, covered in darkness storms across it. The lands are filled with the darkness as it continues to grow. It strikes fear into your soul.

The next room is strange. Through the glass floor, you can see the world. Familiar faces reach up to you with a look of terror on their faces. You can see King Heroldi, the dwarves of Hammerfast, Oaklord, the elves of the forest all reaching out to you. Yet they cannot reach you. Petendithas Oaklord holds a scroll in one hand that comes close to the surface beneath your feet, yet does not cross into the room. King Heroldi holds his hand out with a small statuette of a unicorn. It does not cross into the room either.
The PCs acquired the scroll (planar portal ritual) and the unicorn statuette (a unicorn summons).

Perception DC 25 – The ceiling has images of the gods. Their eyes lie not on the people below, but rather on the doorway ahead. A look of slight worry, unusual for the gods, is upon their faces.

The next room resembles the last in shape. But that’s about it. This room has all its energy focused upon a single chest at the far end of it. The chest is the most elaborate you have ever seen. It radiates a golden light from it. Three dark figures in hoods stand guarding it. Their gaze has been upon you since you entered the room.
If the PCs move forward, the drow attack.
When you open the chest, its as if you begin flying through the sky. Clouds begin passing you at tremendous speeds. You can see a large city in the sky ahead. As you approach it, you see a castle. Next thing you know, you are in the castle staring at a large window overlooking the city. A strange figure stands in front of it staring at the stars in wonderment. He turns and says, “The Gaze is coming.”

The players land back in the Shadow Tomb.  Thalion is waiting.  They fill him in on what just happened.  The group next attempts to cross the bone bridge in the ossuary.  Two phantoms manifest with an army of skeletal beings.  The PCs, luckily, identify the undead as more than mindless.  They are warriors protecting their resting place.  Through a skill challenge, the PCs are able to earn the trust and respect of the undead and cross safely.

Next they find the remains of the shader-kai who entered the tomb before them.  They find a journal that speaks of Acerak and his phylactery.  Finally, the find the shadow engine room.  This room is channeling all of the energy from this place to some unknown location.  An aspect of Acerak, in the form of a floating skull, attacks as the PCs try and disable the engine.  They make quick work of the engine, but Acerak takes a little more time.  Thalion is able to fly thanks to his boots and Shadow is able to invoke the wrath of the gods with is new rod implement.  In a moment of desperation, Shadow summons a fire angel.  He rides on the wings of the angel to Acerak, who is floating high above the battlefield with no need for melee combat.  With a leap of faith, Shadow drives his blade into the skull and it explodes with arcane energy.  The Shadow Tomb has been defeated.

Using their newly acquired portal ritual, the PCs return to Algoria so Argarwane can rule.  He equips them all with special gear before they next set out to find the man who stole their Bag of Holding.</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">As we started to leave, [[:aranil | Aranil]] met with us and told us that [[:starfire | Starfire]] had indeed been to [[Brightkeep | Brightkeep]].  But it had been a number of years since he had seen him.  [[:aranil | Aranil]] then offered to take us to the last known place [[:starfire | Starfire]] had been.  [[:aranil | Aranil]] then magically teleported us to the city of [[Fallcrest | Fallcrest]].  After talking with several townfolk, we decided the best place to ask around for information would be the local taphouses and inns.  We first went to the Netter Inn where we met a noble tiefling.  Who told us about the Markelhay family and the power they have.  Next we ventured to the the Blue Moon Ale House where we met [[:sergeant-murgeddin | Sergeant Murgeddin]] the head of the Guards.  He told us about Old Man Markelhay who during the Great War took the family heirloom, a sword, and hid it in the Guardmore Abbey and was not seen again.  Upon hearing this we decided to visit the Lucky Gnome Taphouse to see if there was anymore information available.  Upon entering we started talking with [[:kelson | Kelson]] who talked about the gang problem in Low Town.  Upon venturing into Low Town we talk to an individual and they tell us about the River Rats, which is the gang that plagues this part of town at night.  We then decide that it would be in the best interest to venture to the Abbey and retrive this sword of power.  Upon leaving town we were stopped by a messenger of [[:armos-kamroth | Armos Kamroth]] who was summoning us to his estate to discuss something.  Upon entering [[:armos-kamroth | Armos Kamroth]]'s estate we were given a very well prepared meal and asked to retrive the Markelhay heirloom from the Abbey.  Kamroth being a collector has an artifact that would enhance the sword and is willing to give us the artifact and the sword on the completion of the job.  We then took our leave to find Moonbane, the family heirloom sword.  Upon arriving at the Abbey we notice we are not alone.  There are many Orcs and other creatures that have taken refuge here.  After defeating the Orcs, Drake, and solving the riddle to gain entrance to a sanctuary where we find an alter with a void of what appears to be something with wings which has been taken.  We search for the sword but at first glance there is nothing to find but an empty sack, but upon [[:boris | Boris]] sticking his hand into the bag he finds it!  Upon completing the quest we immediately head back to [[:armos-kamroth | Armos Kamroth]]'s estate only to find no one.  We enter cautiously trying to find him, in the basement we do find a secret door which reveals a staircase and we proceed.  We then take the left and go down a hallway into a study where we find a sheet of paper titled Incoming Goods which has our names on it and Moonbane, [[:kelson | Kelson]] with Incoming Supplies next to his name, Bartstorman Strongbeard.  Kelson's and Strongbeards names are crossed off.  And finally on the list [[:starfire | Starfire]] with the Wings of Bahamet next to his name.  Downs the other study we find a map of [[Fallcrest | ]] with Teldorthian Arms circled.  We then listen to the double doors in the middle of the landing and the foot of the stairs to the conversations inside where we find out that someone thinks that Starfire has ran with his item.  We then enter and preceed to lie to Kamroth about not finding the sword but leave the two shortswords we did find with him for him to inspect.  We then try to figure someway we could stop the corruption that Kamroth is causing on this town.  </content>

      <title>Welcome to your Adventure Log!</title>
      <published>2010-12-29T12:39:58-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Every campaign gets an Adventure Log, a blog for your adventures!

While the wiki is great for organizing your campaign world, it's not the best way to chronicle your adventures.  For that purpose, you need a blog!

The Adventure Log will allow you to chronologically order the happenings of your campaign.  It serves as the record of what has passed.  After each gaming session, come to the Adventure Log and write up what happened.  In time, it will grow into a great story!

Best of all, each Adventure Log post is also a wiki page!  You can link back and forth with your wiki, characters, and so forth as you wish.

One final tip: Before you jump in and try to write up the entire history for your campaign, take a deep breath.  Rather than spending days writing and getting exhausted, I would suggest writing a quick "Story So Far" with only a summary.  Then, get back to gaming!  Grow your Adventure Log over time, rather than all at once.

      <published>2010-12-23T19:29:00-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Our adventurers set out for the Realm of the Vines seeking the city of Grennal and an elf named [[:rolen | Rolen]].  On the way out of the city, [[:boris | Boris]] the dwarf met them.  He was an old friend of Chigaru's and seeks treasure so he joined the group.  They fought their way through panthers and spiders and discovered the Axe of Terror.  They swiftly defeated two demons guarding the treasure and Boris obtained it.  
Once in Grennal, they wasted no time finding Rolen and getting out.  The tiefling and the dwarf did not feel comfortable in the presence of elves.  Rolen led them to a crossing point to the Feywild and they were able to cross over.  They defeated three Eladrin knights to gain access to Brightkeep.
Inside Brightkeep, they discovered new clues to the mystery of Starfire and new information on the past of Argarwane.  Vengeance was able to locate the head wizard and obtain information on where to travel next.  Will they travel there?  Will they stay at Brightkeep and continue searching through the knowledge within?</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">After our adventurers gathered their wits from a rest, they made their way through the mountain being led by dwarves they had just met.  They made it through the mountain and to the Misty Kingdom.  In the city of Asalia, they met King Antoban Heroldi who had a favor to ask.  They were to rid Mt. Promontor of Kalarel and his evil sorcery.  
Chigaru visited the the scholar at the castle and studied the mountains and the history.  He also got more information regarding the strange text he found in the mountain.  But the information was limited.  To gain more he must travel to Brightkeep in the Feywild.  King Heroldi can help him get there.  
The adventurers set out to the mountain and entered.  They destroyed charmed statues and escaped traps before finally meeting Kalarel in his sanctuary.  He was attempting to summon a portal for the demon lord Orcus to enter the world from the Shadowfell.  After a trying battle and near-death, our adventurers destroyed Kalarel and took his body back to the king.  Misty Kingdom was released from the grip of evil and returned to its beautiful and good state.  Would King Heroldi now uphold the promises he made for payment?  Would he lead them to the Feywild?</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Chigaru, Agarwane, and Vengeance awoke at the inn.  They were told to meet an old man in Stallcroft.  The old wizard known as Petendithas Oaklord told the players that they have a much bigger future than they realize.  They were instructed to travel to the Misty Kingdom with the "sun-up rider," Graster Arroway.  They took Widgeon the gnome along.  They fought through the Western Woods and entered a dungeon beneath the northern mountains.  Here they found a secret study with an interesting journal entry.
 The dungeon began growing colder and they noticed ice covering the pillars and walls.  Moments later they were face to face with a young white dragon.  This was where he was making his lair and his ice cold stare made it known that visitors were not allowed.  An EPIC battle ensued.  Agarwane was knocked unconscious.  Vengeance met the shadow of death but a true friend stepped in and brought him back to life.  Widgeon, giving all he had, sang a song of resurrection on his lute.  This pulled Vengeance away from death's cold hands.  Widgeon fell unconscious with exhaustion.  And it would be the war-pick of Chigaru that brought the dragon to its end.  The adventurers took a much needed rest.</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Three strangers met in the wilderness during a violent electrical storm.  They ran into each other while looking for cover from the hail and lightning.  They found it in an old tor built into a mountainside.  Introductions and backgrounds were given.  Chigaru the assassin Deva remained mostly quiet and mysterious.  Vengeance the warden Tiefling took it upon himself to find out more about the others.  Agarwane the rogue Human was quite reserved.   
Chigaru has lived thousands of lifetimes being reborn into new bodies after each.  Vengeance once led a famed group of warriors into battle many times before being imprisoned.  Agarwane remembers nothing.  His past has been lost.  
The strangers fight their way through the tor finding treasures and defeating villains.  After defeating the zombie bugbear knight that the tomb was created for, Vengeance found himself with a magic weapon forged in the fires of the very blade he'd always carried with him.   The adventurers then left the tor as the storm had calmed a bit and headed into the woods.  There they met Widgeon, a bard gnome whose home had been taken from him.  They defeated the kobolds responsible and let Widgeon take them to the nearest town.  There they met a strange rider who knows Agarwane by name.  Chigaru saw visions of this shadowy figure riding from the Misty Kingdom.  The rider agreed to meet them at the inn at sun-up to talk more.  </content>

h1. The Quest for Starfire

One fateful night, during a violent electrical storm, 3 adventurers sought shelter together in an abandoned tor.  [[:argarwane | Argarwane]], the rogue with no memory, [[:chigaru | Chigaru]], the mysterious deva, and [[:vengeance | Vengeance]], the lone tiefling started out on a journey that would change their fates along with the fate of the world.  !http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/64819/Stallcroft.jpg(Stallcroft)!
In the town of Stallcroft on that fateful night, they were told the prophecy of a coming evil by the wizard [[:petendithas-oaklord | Petendithas Oaklord]].  They would begin the journey that could save this world.  
A mysterious being, known only as [[:starfire | Starfire]], was creating something so powerful that it could challenge the gods.  With the fall of the Nerathi Empire nearly 200 years in the past, everyone is fighting for power.  The heroes must learn more of Starfire and find him before it is too late.  No being should possess power beyond that of the gods.  Will they succeed?  Will Starfire claim the power of the gods?  Will the world be thrown into war?  Only the heroes can determine the fate of the world...!http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/64818/Nerathi_Empire.jpg(Nerathi empire)!

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">Aranil the elder wizard stops the PCs before they can leave Brightkeep.  He gives them some valuable information and clues as to where they should head.  
p. _“If pursuing Starfire is what you seek to do, then you must pick up on his trail.  Starfire left here years ago.  He was young and eager.  He traveled to the world and a region known as the Nentir Vale.  What he was after or where he was headed from there remains a mystery to me.  
	Pick up on his trail.  Discover what he was doing.  Only then will you be prepared to find him.  The fate of all life may depend on your future journeys.  Travel with strength, honor, and dignity.  Protect the weak and innocent.  Only through the evolution of your souls will you gain true power.  
	I encourage you to ask any and all questions you have and purchase any rituals or spells you need to right now.  Brightkeep has the largest volumes of these that you will find anywhere.  You will not return for a long time, my friends.  Once I lead you back to the world, it is there you will stay until the time is right.”_

_“Before you leave, give this to your dwarf friend.  You all gleam with magic armor and it is only fit that he does as well.  This Battleforged Armor will fit him well.  The dragonborn and dwarves still argue over which race invented this enchanted armor.”_    *See PH pg. 227*

Aranil opens a portal to the world and directly to Fallcrest in the Nentir Vale.  
_Aranil speaks in a deep language uknown to all of you.  He closes his eyes and raises his staff.  The very fabric of the air appears to tear, revealing a portal.  On the other side you see a town.  The streets are bustling with creatures of all kinds._   *See DMG pg. 198*

*Streetwise check of 15 points to the three taverns as a place of interest and adventure.*

-Lucky Gnome Taphouse- _Kelson's River Rats_
Kelson is the owner and he’s associated with a gang.
*Streetwise DC 15 – The gang is known as the River Rats and they plague the Lowtown.
Streetwise DC 20 – Kelson runs the gang from his back room at the tavern.*

-Blue Moon Alehouse- _Moonbane_ -Armos Kamroth hears of this and secretly wants a cut
Par Winnomer is the nervous and flustered owner.  The true genius is the halfling brewmaster Kemara Brownbottle.  The tavern is full of halfling traders and two dwarves of significant importance.  Only Sergeant Murgeddin is present right now.

*Streetwise DC 20 - Sergeant Murgeddin knows a secret about a nearby Abbey*

-Nentir Inn taproom- _Serim Selduzar_
Serim Selduzar is a tiefling who has come upon a run of bad luck.  He wants to establish a small manor near Fallcrest since he's the third son of a noble in the south.  He will not inherit his nobility.  His real motives are to overthrow the Markelhay's and establish himself as the new Lord Warden.  
*Insight DC 20 - this tiefling looks around the room at others nervously as he talks to PCs*
*Insight DC 25 - he seems to be a smooth talker and very clever with his words*

_Kelson's River Rats_
The River Rats are currently out and about in the town.  Kelson remains in his backroom doing the bookkeeping for his business dealings.  *Bluff check vs. Kelson's Insight will allow PCs to join his gang*
The River Rats are meeting later that night to rob an incoming supply ship in the Lowtown.  Six of them are robbing the boat.  A reserve group of 6 remains in secret at the tavern in case something goes wrong.  They sit in the back room playing cards with their faction leader while Kelson leads the group at the dock.  
-Encounter 1 at the docks-
*Kelson DMG 205*
*6 Human Lackeys MM 162*
The incoming barge is full of various food items.  Kelson has a gold key.  (This key opens the chambers below Kamroth Estate.  
-Encounter 1.5 at the tavern-
*Human Berserker MM 163*
*5 Human Lackeys*
There are two barrels full of rusty weapons and a barrel that, if searched, has 500 gp.  

_Moonbane_
When the PCs leave the tavern they are approached by a messenger.  He gives them a meeting request from Armos Kamroth up at the Kamroth Estate.  
*Streetwise DC 15 - Armos is a lord that runs owns many of the farms in the area*
*Streetwise DC 20 - Armos is a miser of the worst kind.  He buys up farms and makes slaves of the owners.*
At Kamroth Estate, Armos has a three course meal set up for the adventurers.  The first course is a five forest salad.  The second is a wildberry nut glazed chicken.  The final course is a fruit and cream pie.  While eating, he discusses Moonbane.  He claims to have an artifact that will enhance its power.  If the players would be so kind as to return with the artifact he could enhance it for them.  *Insight DC 20 reveals he has a sly grin upon his face*
If they return with the weapon, he has a trap set up to kill them and take their weapon.  But he is not present.  He claims he was held hostage.  

The players then travel to the Gardmore Abbey.  They must travel east on King's Road until they reach the Gardbury Downs.  There is a road leading north to the Gardmore Abbey.  

_Serim Selduzar_
Serim tells the PCs that when he builds his estate he wants to employ them.  He promises that they can work together to establish a name for themselves in this town.  He asks them to begin right away.  There are plenty of jobs around town.  They should come speak to him when they feel they have done what they can around town.

      <content gm_only="true" format="html">&lt;p&gt;Aranil the elder wizard stops the PCs before they can leave Brightkeep.  He gives them some valuable information and clues as to where they should head.  &lt;br /&gt;
p. &lt;em&gt;“If pursuing Starfire is what you seek to do, then you must pick up on his trail.  Starfire left here years ago.  He was young and eager.  He traveled to the world and a region known as the Nentir Vale.  What he was after or where he was headed from there remains a mystery to me.  &lt;br /&gt;
	Pick up on his trail.  Discover what he was doing.  Only then will you be prepared to find him.  The fate of all life may depend on your future journeys.  Travel with strength, honor, and dignity.  Protect the weak and innocent.  Only through the evolution of your souls will you gain true power.  &lt;br /&gt;
	I encourage you to ask any and all questions you have and purchase any rituals or spells you need to right now.  Brightkeep has the largest volumes of these that you will find anywhere.  You will not return for a long time, my friends.  Once I lead you back to the world, it is there you will stay until the time is right.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Before you leave, give this to your dwarf friend.  You all gleam with magic armor and it is only fit that he does as well.  This Battleforged Armor will fit him well.  The dragonborn and dwarves still argue over which race invented this enchanted armor.”&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;See PH pg. 227&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aranil opens a portal to the world and directly to Fallcrest in the Nentir Vale.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Aranil speaks in a deep language uknown to all of you.  He closes his eyes and raises his staff.  The very fabric of the air appears to tear, revealing a portal.  On the other side you see a town.  The streets are bustling with creatures of all kinds.&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;strong&gt;See &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DMG&lt;/span&gt; pg. 198&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*DM Rights*  The DM has the right to make any ruling regarding anything at the game involving the running of the game that he or she likes. This is up to and including directly overruling any rule written in any book anywhere. This is a code that was put down long ago by Gary Gygax himself.  The DM is the referee, not your friend.  He is there to make the game move along.  

*Unexplainable*  Some things in D&amp;D cannot be explained just as things in real life cannot be explained.  Accept it.

*Enhanced Combat.*  You have 7 seconds to choose what your character is doing for his or her turn.  After that, you will automatically delay.  When the DM opens his mouth to announce this, it is already to late to make a decision.  Be prepared for your turn.  
 
*ROLEPLAYING.*  D&amp;D is a roleplaying game and that's what makes it so much fun.  While we are playing, be your character!  Talk like your character!  Act stupid!  There's no reason to be afraid of roleplaying.  See below for some benefits you can gain from it!

*Respect.*  Be there and ready by the time the game starts.  THIS MEANS BE ON TIME!  *DO NOT bring personal conflicts to the table.*  You are playing your characters and not yourselves.  If a character insults or criticizes you, remember that the CHARACTER is doing it to your CHARACTER. It's not a feud between players so do not take it personally.  Respect the DM.  More often than not, I've put many, many more hours into the game than you.  Remember that.

_*Distractions.*_  DO NOT: USE YOUR PHONE FOR ANY REASON DURING A GAME.  Also, do not roll dice unless you are asked to.  It's distracting.  Listen to the DM as I will not repeat important info if you weren't paying attention.  

*Rolling of Dice*  Your dice rolls do not count if it is not your turn and you have not declared what you are attempting.  No rolling before your turn.  I reserve the right to make you re-roll ANY roll.  

*Rules discussions.*  The DM's call on a rule is final, regardless of the actual rule.  I'll make a note of it and look it up later but rules discussions during game take away from roleplaying.  

*METAGAME THINKING:*
Don't do it!

*After The Fact = Too Late*
We are officially done with "After the Fact" damage and conditions.  If a move or action included something that you forgot to mention before the end of your turn, it is no longer effective.  Know your characters!  Look at feat details and move details.  

*_CHEATING_*  Cheating in any form will get you removed from the campaign.  It's not fun for anyone.

*Most Important*
Have fun!  

*Interrupts - Powers &amp; More*
Especially at epic tier, immediate reactions/interrupts/opportunity attacks are common.  I will try and give a good pause when I expect one.  Only 1 interrupt is allowed per turn.  The player that announces it first will get it.  Also, for interrupts that save you from damage:  Most are triggered by "An enemy hits you with an attack."  You need to announce your interrupt at that point.  *Once damage is rolled, you take it.*  (A rare exception will allow you to know the damage but it will say so in the power)

*LEGIT Roleplaying*
Legitimate roleplaying (unlike any we've seen yet) will now be providing big rewards.  I will reward a hefty amount of XP to anyone willing to *not break character for an entire night*.  Depending on the night this could be anywhere from 20,000-40,000 XP EXTRA for roleplaying.   

*Game Extras*
I have always put in little extra rules to make the game "more fun".  However, to reduce table transactions (which are disgustingly high at epic tier) I will be removing many of them.  
* We will no longer have a magic number that awards Action Points each time you roll it.  
* Critical Fumble and Critical Hit cards will be used at the DMs discretion.  (It takes away from roleplaying when someone shouts "What about a card?!"  I will try to remember to use them on as many occasions as possible.)
* The one extra which will replace all others is the FateShift card.  If you do something amazingly creative/cool or display fantastic roleplaying to achieve a task, I will grant you a FateShift card.  This card allows you to re-roll any d20 roll one time and use the newer result.  These are once again at my discretion and will not be given if asked for.  Consider them rare but use wisely if you get one.  

*Dealing with Multiple Damage Types/Resistances*
"Against Combined Damage Types: Your resistance is ineffective against combined damage types unless you have resistance to each of the damage types, and then only the weakest of the resistances applies. For example, if you have resist 10 lightning and resist 5 thunder and an attack deals 15 lightning and thunder damage to you, you take 10 damage, because the resistance to the combined damage types is limited by the lesser of the two resistances."

*Making Checks/Roleplaying*
When attempting to do something, do not think in game mechanics.  Tell the DM what you would like to do, and if a check is required then he will state that.  Saying, "I'll make a perception check," is HUGE metagaming.  From here on out just say, "I am going to see if I can tell if anything is out of place in this room," or something along those lines.  The DM will determine the check.  </content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DM Rights&lt;/strong&gt;  The DM has the right to make any ruling regarding anything at the game involving the running of the game that he or she likes. This is up to and including directly overruling any rule written in any book anywhere. This is a code that was put down long ago by Gary Gygax himself.  The DM is the referee, not your friend.

Don&amp;#8217;t do it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After The Fact = Too Late&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <published>2010-12-31T15:33:35-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">*Info for Upcoming Event 2-19-11*
* We will be using the white board to draw a live layout as we play.  The layout will include what your players can see as well as enemy placement.  At the beginning of your first turn in combat, you will designate your player's placement.  
* Please review your character BEFORE Saturday and the items and skills you have.  This will allow our game to go smoothly.
* We will NOT be leveling up Saturday since last session there was not much XP gained.  This next session should provide enough to level up for next time. 
* Battle scenes need to go quicker.  If you do not state your move after 5 seconds you allow the enemy to make an opportunity attack on you.  Look over your moves BEFORE YOUR TURN!
* More info may be added here before Saturday so check back a time or two.

* Total Defense - You can use this as your standard action, taking a +2 bonus to all defenses until your next turn.
* You may kill or knock unconscious any enemy when he reaches 0 hit points
* We need to transition into more vivid battle scenes.  Use descriptive and exciting language.

* On skill checks that do not have a drastic outcome you may Take 10 instead of rolling
* You can make a Bluff check once per encounter to gain combat advantage on your next attack.  It's called a feint.  
* Intimidation checks need clarification.  They are rarely threats against someone's life.  They are more of an _implied threat_.  Example:  You intimidate a baron by having your largest ally stare angrily into his eyes while you talk to him.  
* We will have a Q&amp;A session before our next game regarding all the skills and how to use them.
* Remember we are ROLE PLAYING.  Do what your character would do...not you.  Unless your character is Evil alignment he would not kill a person because of an argument.

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We will be using the white board to draw a live layout as we play.  The layout will include what your players can see as well as enemy placement.  At the beginning of your first turn in combat, you will designate your player&amp;#8217;s placement.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Please review your character &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEFORE&lt;/span&gt; Saturday and the items and skills you have.  This will allow our game to go smoothly.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We will &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; be leveling up Saturday since last session there was not much XP gained.  This next session should provide enough to level up for next time.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Battle scenes need to go quicker.  If you do not state your move after 5 seconds you allow the enemy to make an opportunity attack on you.  Look over your moves &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEFORE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOUR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TURN&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/li&gt;

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">The adventurers had Teldorthan Ironhew fashion them a duplicate of Moonbane using one of the two magic shortswords.  He was allowed to keep the other for compensation.  He refuses to forge the Markelhay symbol on it.  He wants to keep his good name.  

1. Tower of Waiting - This tower is mere ruins by now.  *Streetwise DC 15 reveals that a ghost of an evil princess lives beneath the tower, haunting it since its end.  Word is that she dabbled in demon worship* See dungeon.
2. Upper Quays - [[:barstomun-strongbeard | Barstomun Strongbeard]] runs the porters' guild and takes a cut of any wages paid to laborers carrying cargo up or down the falls.  He is extending his reach with his gang of thugs.  They rip off merchants who must send their goods across land.  
3. Five-Arch Bridge - Wooden bridge built over the stone remains of the first that was built by dwarves in Hammerfast.
4. Nentir Inn - Proprietor is a charming half-elf named [[:erandil-zemoar | Erandil Zemoar]].  The money used for the inn wasn't his.  He charmed a noblewoman in the south and fled the authorities.  
5. Knight's Gate - It's run by [[:sergeant-nereth | Sergeant Nereth]] who rigorously enforces all rules.  The guards can't stand him!  He would be most pleased to take care of bad news himself but he cannot leave his post.  He doesn't understand why the PCs haven't done anything yet.  "That's against the law!  Why haven't you stopped them?!"
6. Silver Unicorn Inn - "the Pride of Fallcrest" as it is called charges high rates.  Owned by a stern halfling named [[:wisara-osterman | Wisara Osterman]].  She doesn't like Erandil and can't put her finger on what is bad about him.
7. Halfmoon Trading House - [[:selarund-halfmoon | Selarund Halfmoon]] runs this place.  He is friendly and dispenses an unending stream of advice such as, "It never rains but as someone gets wet!"  or "A nail ain't afraid of a hammer with no handle!"  No one knows what he's talking about most of the time.  He sells mundane tools, gear, supplies, or clothing mentioned in the PH.
8. Moonstone Keep - This keep is the home of the Markelhays.  [[:lord-warden-faren-markelhay | Lord Warden Faren Markelhay]] resides here.  He will gladly pay to have the PCs take care of trouble.  His wife, Lady Allande Markelhay is a female human wizard 4.  
9. The Tombwood - This forest has never been cleared.  In the middle is an old graveyard dating back centuries.  These old crypts are linked by secret passages to dungeons under Moonstone Keep.  The Markelhays were master trap builders so the dungeons will be dangerous!  But no doubt there will be treasure!
10. House of the Sun - temple dedicated to Pelor that was abandoned.  It also includes shrines to Kord and Bahamut.  Recently, a zealous dwarf priest from Hammerfast named [[:grundelmar | Grundelmar]] came to reestablish this place.  He worships Pelor.  He is loud and opinionated and fire-mouthed always talking about smiting evil.  He worries about Trade Road and asks you to search out the Raven Roost lair.
11. House Azaer - High priced mundane equipment from PH.  They run a nice trading company.  Run by Tieflings of the Azaer family.  Amara Azaer runs the business in Fallcrest.  She is young but sharp and doesn't miss opportunities to make money.  
12. The Nentir Falls - 200 feet of three shelf-like drops.  On the small island in the middle of the falls stands the statue of an ancient human hero named Vendar, holding up his hand as if to challenge enemies approaching from downriver.  Local legend tells that Vendar slew a dragon whose lair was hidden in the caverns beneath the falls.  
13. Temple of Erathis - Largest and most influential in town.  Also has shrines to Ioun and Moradin.  Run by High Priest Dirina Mornbrow.  She is convinced of Erathis's dogma.  For a gift to him, she can help with ritual magic.
14. Bluffs - 150-200 ft. tall
15. The Catacombs - Rumors say that in the deepest caverns lie treasure guarded by the undead.  But they are deep, deep within.
16. Moonsong Temple - Devoted to Sehanine.  Also has shrines to Corellon, Melora, and Avandra.  Markelhays worship and give to Sehanine.  
17. Fallcrest Stables - Lannar Thistleton owns this.  This halfling knows a lot of rumors since he sees who comes and goes from town.
18. Wizard's Gate - Sergeant Murgeddin runs this.
19. Naerumar's Imports - this fine place deals in jewelry, art, and magic trinkets.  The owner is Orest Naerumar, a tiefling with impeccable manners and discretion.  He can order in low level magic items given a week or two.  He doesn't ask but will not purchase something he knows was taken illegally.  
20. Kamroth Estate
21. Moonwash Falls
22. Septarch's Tower - This was the mage's guild before the Bloodspear War.  It's now the property of Nimozaran the Green, an old wizard.  His claims to be the High Septarch of Fallcrest yet his guild includes only himself and an unpromising apprentice halfling named Tobolar Quickfoot.  He can teach a limited number of rituals.
23. Blue Moon Alehouse
24. Teldorthan's Arms - Teldorthan remains here and insists that he will not attack anyone in town unless defending his own life.  He can make the players any of the weapons listed in the PH with enough time allowed.  
25. King's Gate 
26. The Market Green 
27. Sandercot Provisioners - The largest general store in Fallcrest.  Owner is Nimena Sandercot.
28. Lucky Gnome Taphouse
29. Lower Quays

Owned by a stern halfling named &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/wisara-osterman" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Wisara Osterman&lt;/a&gt;.  She doesn&amp;#8217;t like Erandil and can&amp;#8217;t put her finger on what is bad about him.&lt;br /&gt;
7. Halfmoon Trading House &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/selarund-halfmoon" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Selarund Halfmoon&lt;/a&gt; runs this place.  He is friendly and dispenses an unending stream of advice such as, &amp;#8220;It never rains but as someone gets wet!&amp;#8221;  or &amp;#8220;A nail ain&amp;#8217;t afraid of a hammer with no handle!&amp;#8221;  No one knows what he&amp;#8217;s talking about most of the time.  He sells mundane tools, gear, supplies, or clothing mentioned in the PH.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Moonstone Keep &amp;#8211; This keep is the home of the Markelhays.  &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/lord-warden-faren-markelhay" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Lord Warden Faren Markelhay&lt;/a&gt; resides here.  He will gladly pay to have the PCs take care of trouble.  His wife, Lady Allande Markelhay is a female human wizard 4.  &lt;br /&gt;
9. The Tombwood &amp;#8211; This forest has never been cleared.  In the middle is an old graveyard dating back centuries.  These old crypts are linked by secret passages to dungeons under Moonstone Keep.  The Markelhays were master trap builders so the dungeons will be dangerous!  But no doubt there will be treasure!&lt;br /&gt;
10. House of the Sun &amp;#8211; temple dedicated to Pelor that was abandoned.  It also includes shrines to Kord and Bahamut.  Recently, a zealous dwarf priest from Hammerfast named &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/grundelmar" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Grundelmar&lt;/a&gt; came to reestablish this place.  He worships Pelor.  He is loud and opinionated and fire-mouthed always talking about smiting evil.  He worries about Trade Road and asks you to search out the Raven Roost lair.&lt;br /&gt;
11. House Azaer &amp;#8211; High priced mundane equipment from PH.  They run a nice trading company.  Run by Tieflings of the Azaer family.  Amara Azaer runs the business in Fallcrest.  She is young but sharp and doesn&amp;#8217;t miss opportunities to make money.  &lt;br /&gt;
12. The Nentir Falls &amp;#8211; 200 feet of three shelf-like drops.  On the small island in the middle of the falls stands the statue of an ancient human hero named Vendar, holding up his hand as if to challenge enemies approaching from downriver.  Local legend tells that Vendar slew a dragon whose lair was hidden in the caverns beneath the falls.  &lt;br /&gt;
13. Temple of Erathis &amp;#8211; Largest and most influential in town.  Also has shrines to Ioun and Moradin.  Run by High Priest Dirina Mornbrow.  She is convinced of Erathis&amp;#8217;s dogma.  For a gift to him, she can help with ritual magic.&lt;br /&gt;
14. Bluffs &amp;#8211; 150-200 ft. tall&lt;br /&gt;
15. The Catacombs &amp;#8211; Rumors say that in the deepest caverns lie treasure guarded by the undead.  But they are deep, deep within.&lt;br /&gt;
16. Moonsong Temple &amp;#8211; Devoted to Sehanine.  Also has shrines to Corellon, Melora, and Avandra.  Markelhays worship and give to Sehanine.  &lt;br /&gt;
17. Fallcrest Stables &amp;#8211; Lannar Thistleton owns this.  This halfling knows a lot of rumors since he sees who comes and goes from town.&lt;br /&gt;
18. Wizard&amp;#8217;s Gate &amp;#8211; Sergeant Murgeddin runs this.&lt;br /&gt;
19. Naerumar&amp;#8217;s Imports &amp;#8211; this fine place deals in jewelry, art, and magic trinkets.  The owner is Orest Naerumar, a tiefling with impeccable manners and discretion.  He can order in low level magic items given a week or two.  He doesn&amp;#8217;t ask but will not purchase something he knows was taken illegally.  &lt;br /&gt;
20. Kamroth Estate&lt;br /&gt;
21. Moonwash Falls&lt;br /&gt;
22. Septarch&amp;#8217;s Tower &amp;#8211; This was the mage&amp;#8217;s guild before the Bloodspear War.  It&amp;#8217;s now the property of Nimozaran the Green, an old wizard.  His claims to be the High Septarch of Fallcrest yet his guild includes only himself and an unpromising apprentice halfling named Tobolar Quickfoot.  He can teach a limited number of rituals.&lt;br /&gt;
23. Blue Moon Alehouse&lt;br /&gt;
24. Teldorthan&amp;#8217;s Arms &amp;#8211; Teldorthan remains here and insists that he will not attack anyone in town unless defending his own life.  He can make the players any of the weapons listed in the PH with enough time allowed.  &lt;br /&gt;
25. King&amp;#8217;s Gate &lt;br /&gt;
26. The Market Green &lt;br /&gt;
27. Sandercot Provisioners &amp;#8211; The largest general store in Fallcrest.  Owner is Nimena Sandercot.&lt;br /&gt;
28. Lucky Gnome Taphouse&lt;br /&gt;

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">Three strangers met in a violent electrical storm.  Courting storm-peace, they sought shelter in a nearby Tor, where they were forced to work together to defeat the monsters within.  From there they headed to Stallcroft where a wizard told them they needed to go to the Misty Kingdom.  
They journeyed through a mountain where they met dwarves, fought a dragon, and found an interesting scroll that spoke of a great being named Starfire.
The adventurers continued on to the Misty Kingdom where they liberated it from the evil grips of Lord Kalarel.  From there they sought out the Feywild which they were told appeared within the Realm of the Vines.  The got there with the help of an elf friend and arrived at their destination, the fabled academy of Brightkeep.  This library housed the largest collection of knowledge known to exist.  They sought more information on Starfire.  The head wizard told them to follow his trail which led to Fallcrest in the Nentir Vale.  They set out to do this.  

In Fallcrest, the adventurers rid the town of a small gang and an underground organization that was promoting illegal activities.  They also defeated two dragons beneath the town and found great treasure in Fallcrest and the Gardmore Abbey.  They sought out the town leader who left for Raywold.  On their journey to Raywold they invaded Raven Roost and left no one alive.  Once in Raywold, they were arrested on site and taken to the castle dungeon.  
[[:antoban-heroldi | Antoban Heroldi]] has requested a meeting with [[:prince-crudak | Prince Crudak]].  He is seeking the adventurers after learning they are in the Nentir Vale.  The Prince is corrupt and decides to capture the PCs because they are too powerful.  The Prince also keeps Heroldi distracted and oblivious to his plan.  The PCs must escape the castle and find the underground resistance movement.  Once they build up the resistance, they can overthrow the Prince and re-establish Raywold as a good place.  
To gain the trust of resistance leader [[:jabar-gimmen | Jabar Gimmen]], the PCs will have to recruit [[:gideon-warhammer | Gideon Warhammer]] for the cause.  
The PCs will then acquire the funds to re-establish the Wizard's Guild.  With the Wizard's Guild online and Gideon Warhammer joining the resistance, they should be powerful enough to take down Prince Crudak for good.  

h3. The Plot Thickens

Tensions are rising too high around the regions.  Bael Turath is rumored to rise from the ashes in the deep southern regions.  The dragonborn aim to stop this.  The Nentir Vale is a disorganized mess of cities who cannot get along.  Algoria prepares for war as they wish to revive the Nerathi Empire of old.  Aestonia is split in three as they all attempt to gain power over the coveted region.  The Western Edge is rumored to be preparing for war, as well.  To top it off, all communications from the distant land of Greyhawk have been lost.  

h3. Dark Times Ahead

Maransa will not accept the God's Chosen and will attack unless their stone is returned.  The Rising Lands will gladly welcome the God's Chosen.  King Heroldi sends a messenger that is intercepted by patrols near New Haven looking for the God's Chosen (specifically Baurus).  Truthfully, the barbarians were only a distraction.  Mindflayers have taken over the Misty Kingdom.  The Cascades will be a hopeless attempt without Vengeance.  Baurus is actually aware of this and working on it.  

h3. Starfire

Starfire is no wizard but he is wise in the way of magic.  He is also a genius.  His project nears completion.  

h3. Underdark

[[The Sanctuary of Kings]] is an entrance to the Underdark.  The players may need to solve the problem that this allows Maransa to come from behind in the battle at the Bleeding Edge.  

Minora also serves as an entrance to the Underdark.  This is where the Mind Flayers came from.

h3. Recapturing the Misty Kingdom

Mind flayers have taken over.  What will the players do?

h3. The Seekers are battered and destroyed...

Gauthak's body is recovered by troops sent in to search for him.  The barbarian shaman was able to bring Gauthak back but with great sacrifice.  The next harvest of the Kinn Su was sacrificed to bring their glorious new leader back to life.  He is injured...
Lomian and Astrid face a much worse fate.  The mind flayers found themselves two new slaves.  The two were taken deep down into the Underdark near the elder brain.  They gather stones (to reinforce a massive cavern) to help create a fortress for the elder brain.  Their gear has been sacrificed to the great pit of acid.  Lomian's new halo of fallen stars remains about his head.  His sword is also safe (but where?).  Astrid has lost almost everything.  

[[:widgeon | Widgeon]] turns out to be [[:widera-kalrunn | Widera-Kalrunn]].  This mithral dragon has been trying to restructure the power in the world and bring civilization to its peak in Aestonia.  

[[:starfire | Starfire]] has discovered the ramifications of his unleashing the Gaze into Astral space.  Luckily, the wormhole closed after the Gaze ended and a heroic ship eliminated the mind-flayer threat.  He is not aware that this Far Realm crossover had awoken [[:yahlrisik-ul | Yahlrisik-Ul]] and resulted in the almost utter destruction of Asalia.  

The Gaze has been turned towards the world as Erathis was displeased by the "misfire" into the Astral Sea.  Starfire is also pleased by the war in Aestonia and hopes that it will create a collapse that he may enter in and rebuild the Nerathi Empire.

To gain the trust of resistance leader &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/jabar-gimmen" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Jabar Gimmen&lt;/a&gt;, the PCs will have to recruit &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/gideon-warhammer" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Gideon Warhammer&lt;/a&gt; for the cause.  &lt;br /&gt;
The PCs will then acquire the funds to re-establish the Wizard&amp;#8217;s Guild.  With the Wizard&amp;#8217;s Guild online and Gideon Warhammer joining the resistance, they should be powerful enough to take down Prince Crudak for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Plot Thickens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions are rising too high around the regions.  Bael Turath is rumored to rise from the ashes in the deep southern regions.  The dragonborn aim to stop this.  The Nentir Vale is a disorganized mess of cities who cannot get along.  Algoria prepares for war as they wish to revive the Nerathi Empire of old.  Aestonia is split in three as they all attempt to gain power over the coveted region.  The Western Edge is rumored to be preparing for war, as well.  To top it off, all communications from the distant land of Greyhawk have been lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Dark Times Ahead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maransa will not accept the God&amp;#8217;s Chosen and will attack unless their stone is returned.  The Rising Lands will gladly welcome the God&amp;#8217;s Chosen.  King Heroldi sends a messenger that is intercepted by patrols near New Haven looking for the God&amp;#8217;s Chosen (specifically Baurus).  Truthfully, the barbarians were only a distraction.  Mindflayers have taken over the Misty Kingdom.  The Cascades will be a hopeless attempt without Vengeance.  Baurus is actually aware of this and working on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Starfire&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starfire is no wizard but he is wise in the way of magic.  He is also a genius.  His project nears completion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Underdark&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/campaign/quest-for-starfire/wikis/the-sanctuary-of-kings" class="wiki-page-link"&gt;The Sanctuary of Kings&lt;/a&gt; is an entrance to the Underdark.  The players may need to solve the problem that this allows Maransa to come from behind in the battle at the Bleeding Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minora also serves as an entrance to the Underdark.  This is where the Mind Flayers came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recapturing the Misty Kingdom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mind flayers have taken over.  What will the players do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Seekers are battered and destroyed&amp;#8230;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauthak&amp;#8217;s body is recovered by troops sent in to search for him.  The barbarian shaman was able to bring Gauthak back but with great sacrifice.  The next harvest of the Kinn Su was sacrificed to bring their glorious new leader back to life.  He is injured&amp;#8230;&lt;br /&gt;
Lomian and Astrid face a much worse fate.  The mind flayers found themselves two new slaves.  The two were taken deep down into the Underdark near the elder brain.  They gather stones (to reinforce a massive cavern) to help create a fortress for the elder brain.  Their gear has been sacrificed to the great pit of acid.  Lomian&amp;#8217;s new halo of fallen stars remains about his head.  His sword is also safe (but where?).  Astrid has lost almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/widgeon" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Widgeon&lt;/a&gt; turns out to be &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/widera-kalrunn" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Widera-Kalrunn&lt;/a&gt;.  This mithral dragon has been trying to restructure the power in the world and bring civilization to its peak in Aestonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/starfire" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Starfire&lt;/a&gt; has discovered the ramifications of his unleashing the Gaze into Astral space.  Luckily, the wormhole closed after the Gaze ended and a heroic ship eliminated the mind-flayer threat.  He is not aware that this Far Realm crossover had awoken &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/yahlrisik-ul" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Yahlrisik-Ul&lt;/a&gt; and resulted in the almost utter destruction of Asalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gaze has been turned towards the world as Erathis was displeased by the &amp;#8220;misfire&amp;#8221; into the Astral Sea.  Starfire is also pleased by the war in Aestonia and hopes that it will create a collapse that he may enter in and rebuild the Nerathi Empire.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">Lord Markelhay has left town.  His departure was unannounced and his destination unknown.  His butler has a note that reads:

_Dearest Carter,
Hammerfast is overextended yet picks up the trail,
Many treks north and you need not a sail.
Tis here I make my destination for an urgent matter.
And be wary of a Gnome full of bumbling chatter.  
He arrived yesterday in search of those travelers so queer,
They appear to him to be very, very dear.  
His intentions were noble but his words a mess.
He resembles royalty in the way of his dress.
Be warned, dearest Carter, of shadowy folk,
They seek only to break the yolk.

Best regards,
Lord Markelhay_

Any of the dwarves in Fallcrest can identify the location on the note as Raywold, home of Prince Crudak.  *History DC 15 - Prince Crudak is the official ruler of the Nentir Vale.  It is common knowledge that he holds no real power in most areas other than the city of Raywold.*

Prince Crudak holds a meeting at the request of King Antoban Heroldi of the Misty Kingdom.  King Heroldi is looking for the adventurers.  Prince Crudak was a good man but has been swayed by dark forces.  He realizes the potential of these adventurers and keeps Heroldi entertained while he instructs his guards to arrest the PCs on site.

*Raywold Town*
# Castle Raywold
# Old Wizard's Guild
# Bank
# Mystic - [[:bersheev | Bersheev]] is a mystic clothed in black and purple robes.  It sounds like a female but is ungendered.  Bersheev never shows its eyes.  It will reveal your future for 10 gp.  Roll a d20.  1-5 is a weak but near future.  6-10 is a strong but near future.  11-15 is a weak distant future.  16-20 is a strong distant future.  
# Exterior Guard Houses
# Raywold Shopping District
# Shiner's Brewery - This brewery is on the upper end of the socioeconomic scale.  Few people drink here and all are wealthy or nobles.
# Belldrinker's Delight - This pub is for the common men in Raywold.  It is usually busy and full of drunken men looking for a fight.
# Dwarfton Corner - Gideon Warhammer and his companions run their own "mini town" complete with housing, grocer, and a superb blacksmith.  
# This is the home of an underground resistance movement.  Jabar Gimmen is a human that has round up various elves, halflings, and humans to his cause to bring down Prince Crudak.  
# Docking Inn - The Inn used by the resistance to shack up new recruits
# Raywold Inn - This is the common Inn in Raywold
# Duprov's Finest - This is the lower socio-economic tavern in town.  The commoners here are looked down upon by other citizens yet this tavern is much more relaxed and fun than Belldrinker's Delight.
# Tonik's Tunics - this establishment has the finest clothing in the Nentir Vale

The PCs will be led to the home of Jabar Gimmen by some of the prisoners.  They will need to acquire new clothing and leave ALL armor and clothing at Jabar's house with all their weapons.  The guards are out looking for them.  

*Raywold Encounters*

_Escape the Guard_
The PCs must succeed in 12 successes before 6 failures while escaping the guard.  
Acrobatics 19, Athletics 19, Perception 15 (+2,-2), Streetwise 23
Success leads to an escape where the PCs will find the resistance.  Failure leads to a combat encounter and possible arrest.

_Joining the Resistance_
The PCs must succeed in 6 successes before 3 failures in a negotiation with [[:jabar-gimmen | Jabar Gimmen]].  
Diplomacy DC 19, Bluff DC 19, History DC 15, Insight DC 19
Success allows the characters into the resistance movement.  Failure leads to the next task.

_Recruit Gideon Warhammer_
The PCs must succeed in 8 successes before 4 failures in a negotiation with [[:gideon-warhammer | Gideon Warhammer]].  
Diplomacy DC 19, Bluff DC 19, History DC 15, Insight DC 19 (Bauris = Diplomacy 15, History 0)
Success results in Gideon and his followers joining the resistance.  Failure is the opposite.

_Re-establish the Wizard's Guild_
The wizard's guild in Raywold has gone into reclusion.  10 years ago, Prince Crudak cut off all funding to the Guild and halting all their progress.  [[:khalim | Khalim]] is the only wizard that is currently at the Guild.  The Guild promises to assist the resistance movement but they need funding.  The PCs will have to secure funding as well as recruit 2-3 wizards to get the Guild going again.  Khalim tells them of a dungeon just outside of town but it will be too dangerous to leave town.  A secret entrance lies in Dwarfton Corner.  The money and wizard's will help get the Guild going again.  They can provide magical items as well as magic firepower to overthrow Prince Crudak.  

_Refer to Raywold Dungeon 2_
"In the shadows it waits, ever so daunting.  Not a creature above can bear its haunting.  In the darkness, many will go to die.  The terror beneath Raywold, a tear to our eye."
# This room contains a key.  An encounter includes 1 Bloodweb Spiderswarm and 4 Deathjump Spiders.  (MM 246)
# This room also contains a key.  An encounter includes 8 Deathjump Spiders.  (MM 246)
# The door has an engraving: "What lies beyond you may not know, but be sure the Underdark, be sure the Drow."
# A dark cave is revealed beyond the door.  A large rock column in the middle rises into the darkness above.  On the other side of it is a stone door.  When the PCs approach the stone door, a blade spider (MM 246) drops from the ceiling behind them.  Two Drow Warriors approach from the darkness as well (MM 94).  One of the Drow has a key to the room.  Inside the room is a treasure chest with 10,000 gp.  

Once the Wizard's Guild has the proper funds it will take at least 2-3 days to get back up and running.  The PCs should explore Raywold during this time.  

*Seizing Raywold Castle*
[[:jabar-gimmen | Jabar Gimmen]] knows that taken the Castle from the outside will be impossible.  Most of the guards dwell around the perimeter or in the guard houses.  The PCs must sneak into the castle and lock it from the inside.  They will then be able to take it by force.  Crudak will need to publicly give up his power or the military will side with him.  Jabar Gimmen has two ideas for getting inside the castle.  The resistance can hold off the military by starting a mess around town and calling out the guard.  The PCs must get in the castle.

Every hour the kitchen staff takes out the garbage.  There are only two guards watching that door at a time but they are Dragonborn.  One Dragonborn has a horn and if it sounds, it is likely that 5-10 guards/minions will show up.  
Inside, the kitchen staff will need to be calmed with negotiations.  6 successes before 3 failures.  Failure will lead to the staff running in panic and possibly alerting guards.  
A guard on duty will stop the PCs in the hallway and ask, "Hello!  Can I help you find something?"
Two Dragonborn soldiers guard the top of the stairs.  
The next hallway is empty containing the windows from option 2.  
   
The PCs could climb to the second story and enter through an open window.  This would negate the need to navigate the first floor but they would have to seal off the second floor.  

After that is the throne room.  Four Dragonborn soldiers, a Dragonborn Gladiator, and Prince Crudak are in this room.  King Heroldi, Markelhay, and Graster Arroway are also in here.  Prince Crudak yells, "Seize the prisoners!"  Heroldi yells, "What are you doing?!"  Intense negotiation follows.

8 successes before 4 failures to convince Markelhay and Heroldi of Prince Crudak's evil.  
Success leads to Graster fighting with the PCs while failure leads to no help.

One of the Drow has a key to the room.  Inside the room is a treasure chest with 10,000 gp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the Wizard&amp;#8217;s Guild has the proper funds it will take at least 2-3 days to get back up and running.  The PCs should explore Raywold during this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seizing Raywold Castle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/jabar-gimmen" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Jabar Gimmen&lt;/a&gt; knows that taken the Castle from the outside will be impossible.  Most of the guards dwell around the perimeter or in the guard houses.  The PCs must sneak into the castle and lock it from the inside.  They will then be able to take it by force.  Crudak will need to publicly give up his power or the military will side with him.  Jabar Gimmen has two ideas for getting inside the castle.  The resistance can hold off the military by starting a mess around town and calling out the guard.  The PCs must get in the castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every hour the kitchen staff takes out the garbage.  There are only two guards watching that door at a time but they are Dragonborn.  One Dragonborn has a horn and if it sounds, it is likely that 5-10 guards/minions will show up.  &lt;br /&gt;
Inside, the kitchen staff will need to be calmed with negotiations.  6 successes before 3 failures.  Failure will lead to the staff running in panic and possibly alerting guards.  &lt;br /&gt;
A guard on duty will stop the PCs in the hallway and ask, &amp;#8220;Hello!  Can I help you find something?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
Two Dragonborn soldiers guard the top of the stairs.  &lt;br /&gt;
The next hallway is empty containing the windows from option 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCs could climb to the second story and enter through an open window.  This would negate the need to navigate the first floor but they would have to seal off the second floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that is the throne room.  Four Dragonborn soldiers, a Dragonborn Gladiator, and Prince Crudak are in this room.  King Heroldi, Markelhay, and Graster Arroway are also in here.  Prince Crudak yells, &amp;#8220;Seize the prisoners!&amp;#8221;  Heroldi yells, &amp;#8220;What are you doing?!&amp;#8221;  Intense negotiation follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8 successes before 4 failures to convince Markelhay and Heroldi of Prince Crudak&amp;#8217;s evil.  &lt;br /&gt;
Success leads to Graster fighting with the PCs while failure leads to no help.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

h3. Changes to Our Game

Here's a few changes to our game in the future:
*XP*
* Experience will need to be earned from now on.  I will go 100% by the numbers.  If you are 5 points short of leveling up...better luck next time.  Fights will still be split up.  You do something cool though and you may get a few more.  XP will be given individually for traps, talking with people, finding key clues, etc.  _I will award some mad XP for anyone who gives me 15 minutes of solid roleplaying without breaking character._  This will make the game more fun since it is an RPG (also see last paragraph)
* I'm transitioning to Obsidian Portal as our campaign home.  Use it to find info on places, people, or past events.  You may even find something you didn't know...
* Each session, I will designate 1 person to write the adventure log after the session on here.  It can be as fancy or brief as you want it to be.  If you do it, you will get a bonus prize for the next session.  
* If you changed your avatar on here and sent me a PM with a magic item level 19-20 that you wanted, you will also receive that in our next session.  
* If you create a wiki page (ask how if you need) related to your character, I will also reward you for that.  Example: Max creates a page for Haramathur under characters, detailing his background and the story of the four warforged, he will receive a bonus prize for that.  For a prize on this one, the page must be well thought out.
* Under the wiki tab we have pages called [[Party Treasury | Party Treasury]] and [[Player Rewards | Player Rewards]].  Player rewards will be where I place your rewards and XP.  You will need to update the Party Treasury page with what you have acquired and spent.  




I think our games can be _so much better_ if we begin describing the environment (my job) and battles (our jobs) in a deeper and more vivid way.  Also, outside of combat, remember that your options for what to do are near limitless.  This is your world that you shape and can do anything in.  Let's get away from the usual "Metagame" thinking and start roleplaying more.  Your decisions should be based on your character and less on what you as a real person would do.  I'm going to do my best to facilitate this because I know it will make our games much more enjoyable and easily more epic.  </content>

Adventurers who recover the cure and save the princess can look forward to a handsome reward from her father, a powerful lord in the Feywild. prOVided that they can escort the petulant, demanding, and spoiled young woman back to his Feywild estate.&lt;br /&gt;

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">Just south of Mount Starris, a valley cuts a scarlike line through the Dawnforge Mountains. Despite the summer heat or the bitter winter cold, a forest forever thick and lush fills this valley. Travelers smell Summerdown Valley long before they see it, as the blooming flowers cast a perfume on the wind.
Despite its appearance, the valley is a place of grave danger. A powerful hag, Queen Stravalla of Winter's Mourning, dwells within this place. In her crystal tower, she surveys the verdant garden that is her realm. Trolls, werewolves, and murderous fey heed her beck and call, and within the ever-verdant forest shamble the animated corpses of those who dared enter her realm. Clad in rusted armor and covered with sickly sweet orchids that grow from their decaying flesh, these sentinels make quick work of those who blunder into Summerdown Valley.

Blooming flowers cast a perfume on the wind as you notice a strangely fertile valley ahead.  The thickness of the forest hides this tropical retreat.  At the far end of the valley, a crystal tower rises just above the trees.  A courtyard sits at the base of the tower with statues of a woman, acting as fountains supplying water to the surrounding brush.  As you approach the fountains the brush on either side moves suddenly and you hear a deafening, howling sound.  Two wolves leap from the brush and two werewolves emerge from behind the fountains.  
Inside the crystal tower, a faint cackling can be heard echoing thru the interior.  The floor is grass just as outside and the tower reeks with humidity.  Two crystal staircases flank an open garden and ascend, spiraling up to the second level.  The ground begins to shake as three large creatures emerge from the dirt and attack.  
Atop the stairs is a large domed room filled with stone statues.  Vines grow from the ceiling and from the statues.  They crawl across the floor as well creating a kind of forest.  An old woman is at the window at the far end of the room.  She turns and lets out a hideous cackle as she disappears.  The cackle echoes from all corners of the room and is joined by howling from all angles.  
_Each thunder attack from the hag destroys the nearest statue.  Statues require a DC 23 strength check to break.  After the Queen is defeated, the PCs will find a gold statuette of her on her desk (worth 1500 gp) along with a vile containing a pink liquid._

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">There is a large door in the mountain with an arch constructed to look like a dragon.  Light is emanating from inside.  Inside a chandelier of candles flicker a dim light over the room.  3 Ogres are at various tables in the room.  One stands and shouts, "Outsiders!  What's your business here?"  "Get out for your own good!"  
* 2 Ogre Savages MM199
* Ogre Skirmisher MM199
A dark stairwell leads deeper into the mountain and ends a fork.  To the left, the smell of cooked meat is wafting thru the air.  To the right, the sound of trickling water can be heard.
# Stone dragon heads protrude from the walls.  They act as fountains, channeling water from their mouthes into stone bowls.  
# This kitchen is warmer than the hallway. The stove is still warm and the smell of stew is thick in the air.  The sound of laughter can be heard thru the wooden door in this room.  Four dragonborn soldiers (MM86) sit eating at a table.  If the door is opened, they all stand ready and one yells, "Outsiders!  Give me one reason not to end your journey right here and now!"
# This room smells of dust and bones as if it has not been opened in ages.  A mangled skeleton lies in the corner wearing a gold helmet.
# In this large room, an oni mage shouts praises to Gruumsh at an altar flanked by descending stairwells.  Three ogres pay dues here as well.  3000gp are in a cloth sack on the altar as a gift to Gruumsh.  

The stairs descend deeper into the mountain and the heat becomes intense.  As you reach the bottom, the stairs meet on a large rock formation above boiling lava.  You can hear the bubbling and popping of the lava a hundred feet below.  Thar stands over the edge looking down.  A griffon guards either side of him, each with a dragonborn rider.  Two ogres also stand watch.  Thar turns around and says in a mocking tone, "Look at this band of misfits.  Just do me a favor.  _Try_ and keep up."  The griffons take flight and the fight begins.

History DC 26 - A clan of dwarves from far away have guarded the secret within the tomb for ages.  Only recently have orcs also taken up residence to guard it as well.  The orcs from the Black Spire entered and struck a deal with the dwarves.  They are not as strong or well organized but they can be found deep within the tomb nonetheless.  

_The tomb is unmarked and a cool breeze flows from the entrance.  Inside there is an open archway leading to a descending staircase.  Down here, the floor is made of stone and the walls carved from the rock of the earth.  It is cool and quiet.  The hallway ends at a spiral staircase leading deeper into the earth.  The door opens into a wide room surrounding a pool of water.  Two doors flank a set of double doors on the opposite side.  The double doors are locked (DC 35) and require two keys.  A chest is also next to the railing._

*Encounter 1* 350 XP
There is a Flame Jet Trap guarding this chest.  (DMG 90)
The chest contains three gems worth 1000gp each.

*Encounter 2* 1100 XP
The orcs can be heard on the other side of the door.  They are talking about the recent word of the dragon attacking Hammerfast.  They are seated around a table.  There are:
1 Orc Chieftain (MM 204)
4 Orc Warriors (MM 203)

*Encounter 3* 1500 XP
There is a room with high ledges surrounding it.  Archers sit atop the 20 foot walls.  An alchemist with two guards are near the table at the other end.  The alchemist has a key around his neck.
1 Orc Alchemist - 600 XP
2 Orc Warriors (MM 203) - 100 XP each
4 Orc Archers - 175 XP each
The table has some useless chemicals, a bag of 500 GP, and a painting of Gruumsh adorns the wall above the table.  

*Encounter 4* 200 XP
Writings on the floor read in Dwarvish:
"A name not spoken, a history forgotten.  A nightmare lost forever in hopes of a better future.  Those brave enough to speak it, shall enter."  The answer is: Calastryx.

Encounter 5
The PCs enter a room full of mirrors.  _As you enter, you notice the room is full of mirrors.  You look at your reflections before realizing you are now looking out at your friends from within the mirror.  A closer look and they are gone.  You are now in a labyrinth, alone.  It is dark and cold._

Each choker worth 600 XP
Each minotaur worth 400 XP

Chests contain: 
Helm of the Eagle (PH 248)
Adamantine Weapon
Iron Ring of the Dwarf Lords (PH 251)

_Brave Adventurers, welcome to Greyhawk! Be not afraid of one of my own who may seek you out here.  His words, although troubling, may provide direction to Starfire.  Also, I have a messenger in the Astral Sea, providing me information of great value.  I am piecing this puzzle together slowly and I will notify you all when I’ve made more progress.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brave Adventurers, welcome to Greyhawk! Be not afraid of one of my own who may seek you out here.  His words, although troubling, may provide direction to Starfire.  Also, I have a messenger in the Astral Sea, providing me information of great value.  I am piecing this puzzle together slowly and I will notify you all when I’ve made more progress.  Lastly, I turn to you Baurus.  The Dwarven city Minora, from which we met you, has vanished.  If you can provide any insight please send word.  Luck to you all, Aranil.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the characters enter the wild, they run into the Eladrin and &amp;#8220;Tomb of Horrors&amp;#8221; begins!&lt;br /&gt;

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">The citizens of Algoria do not recognize Argarwane (the rightful heir to their throne).  They do look strangely upon this odd cast of characters, though.  Heroes are a rare occurrence these days.  

*The Setting Sun*
This tavern is upscale.  The floors are made of stone and marble.  Darion Grimshaw runs the place and acts as bartender.  He knows everything and everyone in town but he doesn't give information freely.  He's a loyal human.  He'll talk all day and night about the fallen Nerathi Empire.  
_Freeblood 7's_ - This card and dice game is the most popular in the kingdom of Algoria.  The PCs can bet in groups of 1000 gp.  A roll of 10 or higher allows for an Bluff check against opponent's Insight. A successful bluff counts as 1 point.  First to 5 points wins.  A roll of 7 on the d20 is an automatic win.  Jandrel Bloomspeak is the most feared Freeblood 7's player in the realm.  His Insight check is + 18 and his Bluff check is +19.

*Medallion Castle*
The high Lord Anobil first recognizes Argarwane.  He asks him to join them in the council room.
Greyhawk has been taken but by what it is not known.  It has been long enough since the fall of the Nerathi Empire that everyone now fights for power.  The Prince of Undeath works in the shadows for his return.  The tieflings of Bael Turath are trying to rebuild their empire.  It's time that man do the same.  Rumors and whispers have reached their ears that a man builds a machine of unspeakable power.  The council wishes to rebuild the Nerathi Empire and use Algoria as the foundation.  _"What say you, King Argarwane?"_

_The warforged realizes what must be done.  Chigaru had reason to believe that Starfire acquired the Infernal Horns of Bael Turath.  Investigating that region could lead to more clues as well as get insight on the progress of the tiefling empire._

Lord Anobil states, "Your grace, would you have your coronation before you set out?  Or shall it wait for your return to Algoria?"  
"Head south to the Dawnforge mountains.  The people of Hammerfast should be knowledgeable enough to help you from there.  But they are a stubborn breed of dwarves so it may take some convincing to acquire their help."

The PCs then begin the [[Journey to Bael Turath]]

# _The entrance resembles a cave that looks half manmade.  The cave follows to the right but it looks like a hallway was added on the left as well._  A perception check DC 25 will notice a crack in the rock to the right.  It looks like a wooden door is behind the rock wall.  DC 22 Strength check will break it down.
# _There are three chests on a dais.  An inscription on the wall reads, "The defender knows to claim his prize, or a ghostly death will soon arise._  The right chest has the prize.  Either of the other chests will trigger a Spectral Tendrils trap DMG 91.
# _This large room is adorned with an unfamiliar writing around the walls.  Five humans stand at a set of double doors at the far end._  "This prize is ours!  In the name of the White Lantern Consortium, I demand that you leave now!"  If the PCs do not leave immediately, the humans attack.
# _This room bears strange resemblance to a tomb.  A dais sits in the middle of the room.  At the far end, you see a stone sarcophagi with a small chest sitting atop it.  The room is covered in dust and bones._  Once all the PCs are near the dais, or someone touches the sarcophagi read, _You hear a deep laughter as a three-headed skeleton manifests atop the dais and brings forth warriors from the bones._
# _Strange markings line the floor in this corridor._  The floor is an electrified trap.  DMG 91.
# _This large chamber is a natural cavern.  There is one large column in the middle of the room.  Lava flows from this column out an opening in the cavern and down the cliffside.  The scent of this lava has a sting to it in addition to the immense heat it gives off._  The ruby dragon statuette is placed in a nook in the column.  It radiates arcane energy.  Once touched, the statue activates.  _There is an explosion of blinding light from the statue.  Lava begins to flow out from the column in various patterns across the floor.  A large dragon manifests itself from the light and screams a bloodthirsty roar.  A large demon also rises from the lava._  The treasure in the chest in the nook of the room is the "Defender's Armor."

A DC 22 Athletics allows a PC to jump a flow of lava.  Anyone who touches the lava takes 1d8 fire damage.  

Upon their return to Nathaniel Varrik, he divulges enough information to get the PCs safely to Najala's Gate.  

_You travel down a winding stone staircase that seems to take hours.  The bottom resembles a large natural cave.  A great archway stands at the far end.  It is filled with fire that sends shadows across the room.  The shadows resemble devils. You hear the angry scream of a woman as the flames grow higher.  Roll initiative._</content>

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">Argarwane was greeted by a group of soldiers from Algoria.  They escorted him back to his throne.  A group of locals recognizes the group for their heroic efforts.  During a tribal ceremony, Shadow is inscribed with the Tattoo of Vengeance as their thank you.  

As they are leaving Vor Rukoth, a group lures them into an assassination attempt.  They are followers of the Raven Queen.  The assassins are dressed with her symbols and announce it.  
A Religion DC 22 knows the following:
The name of the god of death is long forgotten, but she is called the Raven Queen. She is the spinner of fate and the patron of winter. She marks the end of each mortal life, and mourners call upon her during funeral rites, in the hope that she will guard the departed from the curse of undeath. She expects her followers to:
* Hold no pity for those who suffer and die, for death is the natural end of life.
* Bring down the proud who try to cast off the chains of fate. As the instrument of the Raven Queen, you must punish hubris where you find it.
* Watch for the cults of Orcus and stamp them out whenever they arise. The Demon Prince of the Undead seeks to claim the Raven Queen’s throne.

One player rolls a d4:
# All PCs lose 1 magic item while in the "dream sequence"

# All PCs lose 2 healing surges while in the "dream sequence"
# All PCs lose the ability to communicate with each other while in the "dream sequence"
_You can see your friends are with you in the darkness with the exception of Thalion.  Suddenly, there is a flash that cuts through the darkness, temporarily blinding you.  When you can see again, your vision is blurred.  It appears a long hallway stands before you.  Two doors stand on either side._

Door 1 - _You can see Brightkeep, in the Feywild.  A group of wizards sit around a large table with grim looks upon their faces.  You recognize a few of them.  Their sadness reaches out to you._

Door 2 - _You see an underground dwarven city, trapped between the very planes of existence.  The cries of the dwarves strike terror into your soul._

Door 3 - _A familiar kingdom lies before your eyes.  Algoria.  But it looks nothing like it did.  Flames engulf the countryside and cities are in ruins.  You can hear the cries of women and children._

Door 4 - _You can see Greyhawk.  Suddenly, a large army, covered in darkness storms across it.  The lands are filled with the darkness as it continues to grow.  It strikes fear into your soul._

_The next room is strange.  Through the glass floor, you can see the world.  Familiar faces reach up to you with a look of terror on their faces.  You can see King Heroldi, the dwarves of Hammerfast, Oaklord, the elves of the forest all reaching out to you.  Yet they cannot reach you.  Petendithas Oaklord holds a scroll in one hand that comes close to the surface beneath your feet, yet does not cross into the room.  King Heroldi holds his hand out with a small statuette of a unicorn.  It does not cross into the room either._
The scroll is obtainable.  An Arcana DC 23 allows the character to reach through the magic floor.  Damage is taken equal to their healing surge value.  They receive the Planar Portal ritual.
The same process will acquire the unicorn statuette.  The inscription "Eluna" is upon it.  When spoken, a unicorn will travel from the Feywild (once per extended rest) and accompany its owner.

Perception DC 25 - _The ceiling has images of the gods.  Their eyes lie not on the people below, but rather on the doorway ahead.  A look of slight worry, unusual for the gods, is upon their faces._

_The next room resembles the last in shape.  But that's about it.  This room has all its energy focused upon a single chest at the far end of it.  The chest is the most elaborate you have ever seen.  It radiates a golden light from it.  Three dark figures in hoods stand guarding it.  Their gaze has been upon you since you entered the room._
If the PCs move forward, the drow attack.  
_When you open the chest, its as if you begin flying through the sky.  Clouds begin passing you at tremendous speeds.  You can see a large city in the sky ahead.  As you approach it, you see a castle.  Next thing you know, you are in the castle staring at a large window overlooking the city.  A strange figure stands in front of it staring at the stars in wonderment.  He turns and says, "The Gaze is coming."_</content>

      <title>Quest for Quinn</title>

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">The PCs can gain the knowledge (Streetwise DC 24) that Quinn Morlin usually resides in Nenlast.  Jarel Hammerthorn can lead them to Nenlast if they agree to guard his caravan along the way. It's about 40 miles from Hammerfast.  It requires a day and a half of travel.  The first 10 miles is on the King's Road.  During this part of the journey, a wild storm arises over the road.  A DC 20 Endurance check is required to not lose a healing surge.
As the characters turn north from the King's Road, they are attacked.

XP 5000
3 lvl 15 Orc Mercenaries
4 lvl 16 Ogre Bludeoneers 
The total gold on the orc bodies is 5000gp.

_Shortly after traveling about 10 miles north, you hear a growling and whimpering in the woods to the right of the road._  If the PCs examine, read this: _A wolf, dire wolf by the looks of it, is caught in a claw trap.  It's obvious that poachers are responsible.  The wolf is not dead but in bad shape.  It's caught around his neck and he is bleeding profusely._
If Three chooses to heal the wolf, it becomes slightly attached to him (although not obedient yet).  
_Towards midday, you reach the town of [[Nenlast]].  Nenlast sits on the shores of Lake Nen.  The town is surrounded by high stone walls with a group of guards at the entrance._





Treasure found during level 16:

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">h2. Places of Interest

*Hawk Tavern* - The most prominent tavern in Nenlast.  Anyone of importance brings their business here.  Many trade deals are struck at the card tables of the Hawk Tavern.  They claim the best ale in the Nentir Vale as well.  

*Nen Inn* - The PCs can stay here for a normal fee.  The rooms only have 2 beds each.  The owner, Malton Markelhay, is the cousin of the famous Fallcrest Markelhays.  He knows just about everyone coming and going thru Nenlast.

*Nentir Goods* - The PCs can obtain the basic adventuring goods and clothes here.  Nothing magic is sold here but the shopkeeper will pay 2/5 of an item's price which is twice the going rate to obtain some!

*[[:jabar-gimmen | Jabar Gimmen]]* - He is from Raywold, but recently he has gotten into the trading schemes in Nenlast.   

*[[:jaerys-foxstone | Jaerys Foxstone]]* - Jaerys is the most recognizable adventuring figure in Nenlast.  Everyone has heard of him yet few have ever seen him.  He does a good deal of trading since he brings back rare items of high value.  

*Jarel Hammerthorn* - Jarel runs many dealings with Jaerys Foxstone.  Jaerys is always complaining about an aboleth problem in the sewers.  He might be down there a lot...

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">History concerning Arna...
Arna, which translates to The Mossflower in the common tongue, is a large beautifully forested woodland area on the River Moss.  Arna is divided in two by the River Moss, which can be crossed by several bridges or at the crossroads at Summerdell.  It lies just south of the Northlands where the Vryloka's evil kin were banished to long ago, and to the west of [[Asalia | Asalia]].  Aside from the treachery of Kale the Cruel, Arna remains a place of harmony.  Trade is frequent with the neighboring lands, festivals and tournaments of the lance and sword are held frequently in the countryside and the annual Tournament of Fire is held outside Haran, the Capitol of Arna.  Arna is home to many of the best craftsmen, farmers and builders.  
  When Kale the Cruel led the army out of Eriador, the Vampires he had sworn a truce with invaded the city. A resistance was led by the Prince Lomian,  the Vampires were crushed and Kale the Cruel brought to justice. 

Lomian's uncle and mentor, [[:cayne-dawnshadow | Cayne Dawnshadow]], now sits on the throne...hoping for Lomian's swift return.

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">An account of Karyn Wynn,

" ...Then they looked up and could see, and lo! they were at the foot of steep hills, and these hills made a great circle wherein lay a wide plain, and set therein, not rightly at the midmost but rather nearer to that place where they stood, was a great hill with a level top, and upon that summit rose a city in the new light of the morning..."
"...But I looked upon the walls of stone, and the uplifted towers, upon the glistering pinnacles of the town, and looked upon the stairs of stone and marble, bordered by slender balustrades and cooled by the leap of fountains of Amon Galastre..."

An account of The Oath Breaker,

"...Then did the throng return within the gates and the wanderers with them, and I saw they were of iron and of great height and strength. Now the streets of Eriador were paved with stone and wide, curbed with marble, and fair houses and courts amid gardens of bright flowers were set about the ways, and many towers of great slenderness and beauty builded of white marble and carved most marvellously rose to the heaven. Squares there were lit with fountains and the home of birds that sang amid the branches of their aged trees, but of all these the greatest was that place where stood the king's palace, and the tower thereof was the loftiest in the city, and the fountains that played before the doors shot twenty fathoms and seven in the air and fell in a singing rain of crystal: therein did the sun glitter splendidly by day, and the moon most magically shimmered by night. The birds that dwelt there were of the whiteness of snow and their voices sweeter than a lullaby of music. On either side of the doors of the palace were two trees, one that bore blossom of gold and the other of silver, nor did they ever fade, for they were shoots of old from the glorious Trees of Old that lit those places before the Gloomweaver withered them..."

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;#8230;Then they looked up and could see, and lo! they were at the foot of steep hills, and these hills made a great circle wherein lay a wide plain, and set therein, not rightly at the midmost but rather nearer to that place where they stood, was a great hill with a level top, and upon that summit rose a city in the new light of the morning&amp;#8230;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;But I looked upon the walls of stone, and the uplifted towers, upon the glistering pinnacles of the town, and looked upon the stairs of stone and marble, bordered by slender balustrades and cooled by the leap of fountains of Amon Galastre&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An account of The Oath Breaker,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;&amp;#8230;Then did the throng return within the gates and the wanderers with them, and I saw they were of iron and of great height and strength. Now the streets of Eriador were paved with stone and wide, curbed with marble, and fair houses and courts amid gardens of bright flowers were set about the ways, and many towers of great slenderness and beauty builded of white marble and carved most marvellously rose to the heaven. Squares there were lit with fountains and the home of birds that sang amid the branches of their aged trees, but of all these the greatest was that place where stood the king&amp;#8217;s palace, and the tower thereof was the loftiest in the city, and the fountains that played before the doors shot twenty fathoms and seven in the air and fell in a singing rain of crystal: therein did the sun glitter splendidly by day, and the moon most magically shimmered by night.

      <title>The Flushing Raynes</title>
      <published>2011-08-27T21:41:03-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">*Below are the histories of the Flushing Raynes.  Upon discoveries of vampires within the royal bloodline, the Cascades banded together and annihilated the family and most of its history.  The lands were given to [[:matrius-highmount | Matrius Highmount]].*

The House of Rayne was once the greatest of the houses of Men, having at the time of their coming to this region, a fortune of both arms and gold beyond any mortals reckoning. "For the most part they were tall people, with flaxen or golden hair and blue-grey eyes, but there were not a few among them that had dark hair, though all were fair-skinned."  The People of Rayne were "quick to wrath and laughter, fierce in battle, generous to friend and to foe, swift in resolve, fast in loyalty, joyous in heart, they were known as the Golden Ones in the youth of Mankind."  They were akin to the house Morlin.
The vanguard of the Greater Folk, now led by one Marach, were the first to reach the The Everwinter, but they were daunted by the heights and turned southward, seeking a way round the Mountains. Thus they came to Asalia from the North when the other Houses had already settled. Marach therefore led his people to the plains just below the Grey Mountains, where they settled to the east of the Folk of Aegrias, the dragonborn.
The House of Rayne became the most renowned of the Cascades, fighting for the people of Aegrias and those of the Realm of the Vines to the west. They were moreover hardy to endure cold and feared not at times to go far into the north and there keep watch upon the movements of Vampiric forces. 
A great battle with an ancient house far in the north all but destroyed this once glorious house. The remnant of the House of Rayne was then put to thraldom; those able to work were taken to mines of the north or laboured as slaves for the Incomers, and the old were killed or driven out to starve. 
Vampiric' lordship under Morgothian lasted nearly a century, until the Host of the Heroldi arrived in the cascades and the War of Wrath began. The remnants of the Houses then fought on the side of Heroldi's Forces, and after the defeat of Morgothian, they were granted the Flushing Raynes to dwell in. The descendants of the House of Rayne composed the majority of its population. Most of the people of [[Asalia | Asalia]] and [[Stallcroft | Stallcroft]] was thus also descended from either the House of Rayne or those of their folk that never crossed the Blue Mountains.

Cross into the Cascades and travel far north.  Look to the west underneath the Great Mountain Range and you will see the glory that is the Aegrias Prime.  The sprawling stone estate lies at the base of a small mountain.  Tunnels lead into the mountain from the rear of the estate.  High walls surround the entire landholding.  The towers and faces of stone resemble dragons in their making.  Fit for a stronghold of dragonborn.  
The Aegrias bloodline goes as far back as the dragonborn race itself.  Abraxus Aegrias first brought his family to Aestonia before the Nerathi Empire.  Their former kingdom gave them the honor of starting a dragonborn settlement in a new land.  Their former kingdom was also thrown into ruins shortly after, leaving the Aegrias family cut off and alone.  Their spirits were as strong as their muscled backs though and they created an estate and wealth unimaginable.  The current heir to Abraxus is [[:kriv-aegrias | Kriv Aegrias]].  
The city is 90% dragonborn.  The culture is strictly from the ancient dragonborn ways and everyone follows and respects that.  The Aegrias family has provided a wealthy and safe home for ages and the occupants are more than happy to recognize this.  The other 10% of the population is a mixture of humans, halflings, and dwarves.  Few elves inhabit the city but can be found.  A sprinkling of gnomes, goliaths, and other creatures are seen occasionally.

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">h4. A Story of Coming War by Legarius the Wise

*The Seat at Risencrest*
It was always spoken, "He who holds the seat at Risencrest, holds reigns to all Aestonia."  And thus, the seat at Risencrest is a most prized possession of power.  Never has one throne claimed so many a king, so many a bloodline.  Risencrest, settled firmly to the east of the Crested Downs, is a fortress.  Protected to the east from Maransa by the Downs, and from the north by the Rising River, it remains one of the most difficult seats to acquire by force.  And so our story begins not with war, but rather deceit and trickery.  Threats from within are often deserved of the highest fear.  
*Marvella's Wonder*
With King Blackstone (Laurent, first of his name) in charge of Risencrest, the Rising Lands were prosperous and expanding.  Whispers of a new kingdom in the north did not bring about fear yet the talks of Maransa stole the king's sleep.  Scouts had placed thousands of airship vessels in Maransa within the last tenday.  Troops from somewhere in the Western Edge had also joined up in [[Maetrage | Maetrage]].  King Blackstone had his forces around Risencrest doubled and set forces at various hidden outposts across the Risen Lands.  He expected war.  Maransa had, after all, known nothing but evil in his eyes.  
Less than a tenday after his reinforcements, a strange woman dressed in gypsy garb arrived at the castle requesting an audience.  Marvella was the name she gave.  With her she brought only one gentlemen to pull her cart.  He was the strangest of men.  His green eyes tore deep into your soul and he spoke not a word.  Marvella swore she could show the king his future if he would only repay her with a guarded caravan to her home in Maransa.  The king, being on edge from his sleepless nights accepted the offer.  A grave mistake that still haunts his bloodline.  
Marvella conjured a fine mist in his throne room while whispering words of an unknown past.  As the king leaned in to view his future, he was pulled from his seat and sent into the mist.  Accounts of guards in the room say that he turned to mist himself as his screaming faded from earshot.  At once, the guards attacked but were rendered immobilized by the evil witch.  She took the throne for herself.  Troops entered the room to harness her only to find her strange friend transformed into a towering dragon.  The king's troops were now hers.  She executed the queen but the prince was no where to be found.

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">*Black District*
This district is the slums.  Buildings are wooden and falling apart with few people in the streets.  Most avoid the area that do not live there.  Littered with taverns, crooks, and thieves, this place is often sought out by those looking for key information.  _The Crested Goat_ is the least shady of the taverns yet it is full of thieves and liars still.  They have the finest ales in the Black District.  _Harpoon's Willow_ is a newer tavern with growing popularity.  The ale is decent but the crooks are plenty.  This place is much more dangerous.  [[:rustig-harpoon | Rustig Harpoon]] runs this place (and some say much more).  
*Common's District*
This district holds most of the housing for the people of Risencrest.  The buildings are wooden with a few stone and are well-kept.  _The Tainted Kobold_ is a much more secretive but favorite tavern.  _The Iron Dagger_ is the popular tavern among the district.  The people here revere the brothers Malachai.  [[:pieter-malachai | Pieter Malachai]] and his brother [[:jayson-malachai | Jayson Malachai]] are popular among the common-folk and often represent them in the courts of Castle Blackstone.  These two nobles came from street-rats to noble status through their foiling of a Maransan spying network in Risencrest.  They know better than any how the town works.  
*Market District*
Here you can find most of the shops and markets.  Wooden buildings that are welcoming cover this district.  Markets here favor clothing above all else.  Luxurious clothings from all over Aestonia can be found here and especially from the Nentir Vale.  Other goods here include fresh foods, some armor and weapons, and a few magic goods.  No prominent figures live here yet some places of interest include Podego's Linens, Yandar's Combat, and Silvar's Accessories.

This district holds most of the housing for the people of Risencrest.  The buildings are wooden with a few stone and are well-kept.  &lt;em&gt;The Tainted Kobold&lt;/em&gt; is a much more secretive but favorite tavern.  &lt;em&gt;The Iron Dagger&lt;/em&gt; is the popular tavern among the district.  The people here revere the brothers Malachai.  &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/pieter-malachai" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Pieter Malachai&lt;/a&gt; and his brother &lt;a href="/campaigns/quest-for-starfire/characters/jayson-malachai" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Jayson Malachai&lt;/a&gt; are popular among the common-folk and often represent them in the courts of Castle Blackstone.  These two nobles came from street-rats to noble status through their foiling of a Maransan spying network in Risencrest.  They know better than any how the town works.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Market District&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here you can find most of the shops and markets.  Wooden buildings that are welcoming cover this district.  Markets here favor clothing above all else.  Luxurious clothings from all over Aestonia can be found here and especially from the Nentir Vale.  Other goods here include fresh foods, some armor and weapons, and a few magic goods.  No prominent figures live here yet some places of interest include Podego&amp;#8217;s Linens, Yandar&amp;#8217;s Combat, and Silvar&amp;#8217;s Accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PCs must obtain a gold-crested, hand-signed charter from the King to bear arms and roam the countryside freely during times of war.  This cost 1500gp.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">*A word by Morgenroth...*(written by Jeff Morgenroth)
The world’s humans are scattered and divided, engaged in a losing battle against the darkening world and their own ignorance
It wasn’t always so. Once, the splendor of Nerath lit the world with its culture and accomplishments. It united races and governed prosperously. Nerathi architects raised marvels of engineering; its artists composed works capturing the imagination; and its philosophy formed the foundation of humanity’s ideologies. Yet none of these feats could save Nerath from destruction.
Humans today are the inheritors of this legacy, though few of them realize what their ancestors lost with the empire’s fall. Although Nerath now means little more than ancient legends in the shadows of crumbling ruins, every person of every race alive in the world today shares this common thread to their history—that once, Nerath ruled, and the world was a better a place.
There are those who would see it so again.

h5. The Birth...

In the wake of the Great War, the dragonborn and tiefling were decimated.  Once-great races of power and nobility were strewn across the lands, desolate and poor.  
Dragonborn were pitied.  The great and powerful race was now in shambles and scattered throughout the lands, left far from a crumbled homeland by the travels of war.  
Tieflings were scorned and hated.  Rumors and enemies grew.  "_He who deals with devils deserves this fate._"  The devil-pact humans were forced to leave their ruined homeland and move on with their lives, knowing that their greatest days were behind them.  
The world was thrust into darkness as the magic from both sides of the war distorted not only reality, but the very dreams of mortals in the world.  Much was forgotten as darkness set in.  Evil lurked in the shadows and chaos should have ensued.  But a point of light shone in the distance.  A light in the west pointed towards a new hope, a new future...for man.

h5. A Light For All Mankind

In the wake of the destruction of the Great War, the human race began to rise in power.  Nomadic tribes had began to settle in cities during the Great War and it was these growing cities that were left in the west after the destruction of the ancient empires.  Shortly after the war had settled, a 15 year old named Magroth gained power as a strong leader and founded the imperial capital.  Scrolls speak of his brave acts including his victory over Ayunken-vanzen, the ancient gold dragon whose lair was beneath the land Magroth desired for his capital.

After helping cure the horrific Ashen Plague, the empress of Magroth, named Amphaesia, disappeared back to her home in the Feywild. She was never seen in the world again. </content>
      <content gm_only="true" format="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A word by Morgenroth&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;(written by Jeff Morgenroth)&lt;br /&gt;
The world’s humans are scattered and divided, engaged in a losing battle against the darkening world and their own ignorance&lt;br /&gt;
It wasn’t always so. Once, the splendor of Nerath lit the world with its culture and accomplishments. It united races and governed prosperously. Nerathi architects raised marvels of engineering; its artists composed works capturing the imagination; and its philosophy formed the foundation of humanity’s ideologies. Yet none of these feats could save Nerath from destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
Humans today are the inheritors of this legacy, though few of them realize what their ancestors lost with the empire’s fall. Although Nerath now means little more than ancient legends in the shadows of crumbling ruins, every person of every race alive in the world today shares this common thread to their history—that once, Nerath ruled, and the world was a better a place.&lt;br /&gt;
There are those who would see it so again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src="http://cdn.obsidianportal.com/assets/64818/Nerathi_Empire.jpg" title="Nerathi empire" alt="Nerathi empire" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;The Birth&amp;#8230;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the Great War, the dragonborn and tiefling were decimated.  Once-great races of power and nobility were strewn across the lands, desolate and poor.  &lt;br /&gt;
Dragonborn were pitied.  The great and powerful race was now in shambles and scattered throughout the lands, left far from a crumbled homeland by the travels of war.  &lt;br /&gt;
Tieflings were scorned and hated.  Rumors and enemies grew.  &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;He who deals with devils deserves this fate.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;  The devil-pact humans were forced to leave their ruined homeland and move on with their lives, knowing that their greatest days were behind them.  &lt;br /&gt;
The world was thrust into darkness as the magic from both sides of the war distorted not only reality, but the very dreams of mortals in the world.  Much was forgotten as darkness set in.  Evil lurked in the shadows and chaos should have ensued.  But a point of light shone in the distance.  A light in the west pointed towards a new hope, a new future&amp;#8230;for man.&lt;br /&gt;
~Aranil Elrohmer&lt;br /&gt;
       Brightkeep Academy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;A Light For All Mankind&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the destruction of the Great War, the human race began to rise in power.  Nomadic tribes had began to settle in cities during the Great War and it was these growing cities that were left in the west after the destruction of the ancient empires.  Shortly after the war had settled, a 15 year old named Magroth gained power as a strong leader and founded the imperial capital.  Scrolls speak of his brave acts including his victory over Ayunken-vanzen, the ancient gold dragon whose lair was beneath the land Magroth desired for his capital.  After his victory, he lit the &lt;a href="/campaign/quest-for-starfire/wikis/Flame%20Imperishable/new" class="create-wiki-page-link"&gt;Flame Imperishable&lt;/a&gt; in the imperial capital and began his decades-long marches of expansion that would conquer most of the known world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;After the Fall&lt;br /&gt;
After helping cure the horrific Ashen Plague, the empress of Magroth, named Amphaesia, disappeared back to her home in the Feywild. She was never seen in the world again.&lt;/h5&gt;</content>

      <title>Ashkahir Faeldaroch</title>
      <published>2012-05-17T13:58:43-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">The following is an excerpt from the tale of King Grenwyck of Aestonia:

...And lo did great Grenwyck, known as the Drake of Aestonia, step out from the ruin of his castle. Brandishing his great sword Ash he walked forth toward Ashkahir Faeldaroch, the burning death. "Fool," the beast spat, fire dripping from its jaws, "thou knowest not what thine folly brings upon thee. Better to lay thyself down and accept the fiery end that I offer thee than to continue this attempt on my life. For so long as the fires within the earth may burn, so shall my life's fire be lit." 

With that the great dragon took flight. As Grenwyck fell forward to the earth succumbing to his wounds, then did Pelor speak forth, "Grenwyck, raise thyself up and go forth to chase the Burning Death, for thou and those of Aestonia are mine chosen people. This attack upon mine and my kingdom shall not go unpunished." And then did Grenwyck stand, relieved of his mortal pains, "Take with thee my hammer and leave thy worldly armaments aside." And so did Grenwyck, and he found in his hand a mighty hammer shining brilliantly with Pelor's light.

So forth Grenwyck went from his castle ruins and for three days and three nights did he pursue Ashkahir, until he found him, and brought him down to the earth with a bolt of Pelor's light sent forth from the hammer, in the mountains near the city of Minora. As the dragon fell to the earth he did curse Grenwyck's name. Yet when the dragon did look upon him, the Aestonian seemed to shine with the light of another, and it could be seen that for a time Grenwyck and Pelor were one in the same. With a great fury He smote the dragon, and great chains dragged themselves forth from the stone. With every strike more chains came forth until the great beast was bound completely. The dragon lashed out, snapping at Grenwyck, yet found itself unable to move. "Though I cannot escape these infernal chains, I yet have power in me to curse thee Grenwyck the Drake of Aestonia! For thine house shall see ruin, and thine heir shall be carried forth on wings of darkness, lost in the time of thine people's greatest need. 

Grenwyck struck the beast a final time, binding its head and its mouth shut. Then, in a voice not of his own he spoke, "Thou Ashkahir Faeldaroch the Burning Death, hast slighted Pelor. In doing so thou hast forsaken the light." With these words the dragon's eyes were stricken blind. As the beast howled the voice within Grenwyck spoke once more, "As punishment for thine deeds, may thou find companionship only with the stone henceforth." Then did Grenwyck strike the ground with his hammer, and it opened up beneath Ashkahir Faeldaroch, the Burning Death, and his binding chains pulled him down deep into the mountains below Minora. Thus did Great Grenwyck the Drake of Aestonia bind the Burning Death and save those of his country from its wrath. </content>

This isolation is really what led to the self-reliant culture born in Lysoria.

      <published>2012-05-29T22:30:54-06:00</published>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">     Nearly 2,500 years ago, a battle between Heironeous and his half brother Hextor was raged on the plains of what is our world.  While Heironeous and Hextor were not always enemies, this all changed quickly  when Hextor chose to directly interfere with the world and burn down a city on the east coast of an island called Enfellthor.  

     Coming to terms with the fact that he and his brother were on opposite sides of the moral compass, Heironeous decided (after a long personal argument) that his brother must be stopped and he must sever ties with him once and for all.  Being as his brother was the God of war, he knew he must think of a strategy to win when the final confrontation would occur.  

     Heironeous then spoke to Celestian.  He asked him to construct him a weapon that he could use to defeat his brother, regardless of the strategy he would use.  This was not a war that Heironeous was willing to sacrifice human life in, and that he must confront his brother personally, in human form.  Celestian created the weapon that Heironeous asked for and told Heironeous that he would one day contact him for payment.  

     Heironeous went to the world of mortals and called to the sky, demanding that Hextor come down and face him like a man.  When Hextor arrived, he was all but confident that this would be the end of his brother.  But Hextor was ill-prepared for what Heironeous had in store for him.  The first thing that Hextor noticed when arriving to the world, was his brother's shimmering new gauntlets.  Coated in black gold and platinum, the gauntlets were a sight to behold.  Hextor knew that when he finally slayed his brother, he would take them for himself and all would marvel in their beauty.  

     When he noticed that his brother was not carrying a weapon,Hextor took his gleaming hammer off of his back, and swung down at Heironeous.  Heironeous put up his arm, and what happened next, Hextor could hardly believe.  A large wall-shield had appeared out of no where, attached to Heironeous' arm.  The hammer crashed down on the shield and Heironeous pushed the hammer away.  Backing up, Heironeous' shield disappeared, and was replaced by a great sword in either hand.  The weight of the weapons seemed to be that of a feather, and everything that the gauntlets made appear seemed to be but a ghostly, glowing figure of what was actually there.  The war raged and Heironeous' gauntlets worked marvels.  The gauntlets could make any weapon or shield appear.  Bows, infinite arrows, large hammers, swords, and daggers, no weapon was too much for the gloves.
  
     Once the battle was through, and Hextor lie on the ground, defeated, Heironeous commanded him to return to the heavens and never return or interfere again.  Hextor agreed and disappeared. Heironeous looked down at the gauntlets and decided he no longer needed them because the threat was gone.  He took the gauntlets to a part of the world where many had been slain and evil was so great that no one could ever reach the powerful weapon.  There has been word that this weapon still exists, and it's power has grown over time.</content>

This group is collecting artifacts from around the world and bringing together the remnants of the Empire of Bael Turath.  They realize that dealings with devils were not the answer and are willing to speak with the Aegrias Prime to cover the hatred between groups.  They will not speak first of course as they have too much pride.  </content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">h4. Misty Kingdom

The Hedrol Mountains provide ore deposits of copper and iron.  Some claim that gold deposits can be found in the far northern regions.
The seaside communities provide a good deal of fish and crab as well as pearls in the northern region.  
The Misty Kingdom can be cooler yet still provides fertile farmland.  Rich in berries and fruits, the Misty Kingdom also grows a good deal of greens and grains.

h4. The Rising Lands

The lands here are not as fertile for farming yet a few regions provide a decent amount of corn,  soybeans, and grains..  
The seaside communities provide an overwhelming amount of fresh fish and seafood.  Crab is not found in this region though.  Swordfish, shark, and a variety of smaller fish are caught in masses on a daily basis.  

h4. Maransa

This desert is not fertile for farming of any sort.  
Some mines in the area are said to hold gold but Maransa's largest export is [[Astia | Astia]].  It is found in great amounts all over Maransa and especially concentrated near the city of Maetrage.  

h4. The Cascades

Considered the most fertile land in all Aestonia, the Cascades are flourishing with resources.  Farms produce foods from potatoes to beans, from berries to apples and oranges, and everything in between.  Fresh grains are never too far away, either.  The nearby woods provide a good deal of lumber.  The lakes harvest freshwater fish.  The Aegrias Prime have access to the Great Mountains as well. 

h4. The Great Mountains

This enormous mountain range is rumored to hold host to a plethora of precious metals.  Iron, copper, and gold deposits are common if you know where to look.  Some say silver streams can be found within the range as well.  Diamonds are not uncommon in the deep of these mountains.  

h4. The Northern Mountains

Gold, iron, and copper can be found deep under the northern mountains as well as streams of silver and diamonds.  These mountains however were much more frequented than the Great Mountains.

h5. Lysoria

Livestock and hardier grains are the most common resources in this desolate region.

h5. Stallcroft

This farming community provides a good deal of lumber from the woods surrounding it.  
The farmlands to the south are rich with grains, fields of greens, and orchards of fresh fruit.  The farming keeps the community alive.  

h5. Arna

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">From the personal writings of Archwell Brinstein world traveler extraordinaire:

Day 1" I have just arrived at the Ohgean Islands, curious home to many races that has remained untouched in the years since the fall of the Nerathi empire. I have come in an effort to document the lives of these people and seek out answers as to how this remote paradise has remained pristine for all of these years..."

Day 5 " The natives of the island are perfectly civilized although somewhat secretive. No one can blame their mistrust of an outsider though, far be it from me to criticize their ways, what with the success they have found in keeping safe in these increasingly dark times. The island seems to have ample resources to keep the island sustained. The odd thing is, I have seen several gold veins in the rocky outcroppings around the hub village of Craftholme and yet the trade to this island appears to be nil. These people seem to have created themselves some sort of self sustaining culture. Very interesting. And with that I shall retire to the tolling of the midnight bell." 

Day 7 " Something odd to report. I have seen some ships arrive in the past few days and when I approached the dock I was ushered away by two kindly faced guards who simply told me that the ships were for prisoner transport. I could swear I distinctly saw people being led off of the boats rather than onto. Perhaps I shall investigate this further in the future..."

Day 8 " A new shipment of "prisoners" was brought today. I managed to sneak a spyglass with me to a high point on the island not far from the docks and I distinctly saw people of various races exiting the boat blindfolded and bound. One of the villagers nearly spotted me but I managed to duck behind a rock and keep myself well under cover. I plan on leaving this island first thing in the morning and heading to Arna. It appeared the ships bringing the "prisoners" was flying an Arnese flag and I believe the king could elaborate on this odd transfer of people. 

Day 9 " The midnight bell just tolled and I hear the approach of many feet outside my small shack. I see torches burning and I fear I have made some terrible mistake in my search for answers. I shall attempt to make my escape but if, for some reason, I am unable, I hope that this book will explain my....."

Day 30 " I have found my old logbook from this trip. It seems I was more distressed than necessary, for this place has become my home. My family here was only approaching to show me the light of the Ancient Ones. I feel as though I have found a light in my soul that I had never known existed before.

Subject: Missing Shipment

Your Grace, I have received ill news from one of my caravan guards who had been travelling with your recent shipment from the Nentir Vale that you personally requested. 

First I would like to make it clear that though you hired my guard, one made note of the weaponry and general skill of the caravan members themselves. Though it seems in ill taste I must make certain that I am well compensated for the 1-1 ratio of guards to caravan members that I pride myself upon when making shipments. 

However, the true problem is that overnight the caravan itself seemed to have been entirely ransacked and the members of the caravan captured. My guards awoke one morning, a days ride from Risencrest, to find the wagons, cargo and all, destroyed. As well as every member of the caravan completely missing. My guards claim no personal injury, but I must admit my complete bafflement as to what could have happened. To this end I must once again ensure that my compensation is forthcoming for though the shipment did not "officially" arrive, the guards did make true on their word to accompany it at least most of the way to Risencrest. As the boxes were quite light, I assume the contents could not be particularly valuable goods being shipped, so I do not feel that a dock in pay is necessary. 

If you have any questions or concerns with my request for compensation in full, I am at your disposal, and I pray you decide to use my services should you require a shipment delivered again. 

Sincerely,
Garl Thondak, Principal Caravan Supervisor for the Darkwyrm Shipping Co.


To Garl Thondak,

You shall receive your compensation in full, as well as a discretionary sum to prevent your mentioning of this shipment to any interested parties. If word were to get out of this shipment to any interested parties, then word could potentially leak as to the ability of the guards of the Darkwyrm Shipping Company's to protect the goods being shipped. We thank you for your cooperation and will contact you if we have further need of your services.

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">*The following is an excerpt from a message sent from Grennal to Raignoria:*
To the Most High Council:
With barbarians laying siege to Asalia, the turmoil in the cascades, and now the added threat of barbarian invasions from the west, our numbers grow far too thin.  We do not have the garrison to patrol our entire borders both night and day.  We need more men.  The High Council must act soon or the war will break through our borders and the tides of darkness will sweep over our land, even unto Raignoria.  Time is of the essence.
-Rolen, of Grennal

*The following is an excerpt from the personal journal of Sithek, Commander of the Western Patrol*
_Entry #3 of the New Moon_
Something isn't right.  First the barbarians were coming in raiding parties, but now they are coming droves.  They have been worked into a frenzy and they come by the hundreds screaming and crying as if they were being chased by death itself.  With so few under my command I am unable to turn them all aside.  I have been forced to send search parties to weed them out and drive them from our lands.  We cannot escape this war forever, the High Council must see this.  The war is creeping in on all fronts and soon it will be on our doorstep.
_Entry #5 of the New Moon_
Late this evening one of the search parties came back with a bound male crying and wringing his hands.  He was covered in blood, but it was not his blood.  My men tell me that they found him crouching in a bloody mess with a knife in his hands.  His family lay about him, all their eyes were open and full of fear.  Blood trickled from the corners of their mouths and a jagged wound was opened from ear to ear.  I tried to calm him and interrogate him, but he only offered two words.  Darkness and Death.  More of my men are hearing whispers of the Vampire Clans raiding the Barbarian villages.  This cannot be true.  The Prince of Arna drove them from the mountains and burned their King.  Time will tell, for now I have my orders, but if the High Council will not give me more men...may the Gods be with us.  A horn blast in the distance, at this hour? I must see to this...
Thus ends the last entry in Sithek's Journal.

It was designed to give massive power to whomever wields it, but only for one year.  After that one year is up, the warrior who wields it will not only die a death that can never be broken, but their soul will be cast down to the underworld and fed on by Lord Orcus himself.  Some believe that this sword was the weapon of choice for the god Nerull.  He crafted the sword so that all who tried to oppose his power would be dragged to the underworld no matter what.

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">The port resting south of Asalia is called both “Lady's Love” and “Bahamut's Grace” depending upon who you ask.  Ages ago it was originally the residence of aquatic elves who practiced a very particular form of magic concerned with probabilities and luck.  Through the generations the magic warped the area into a place where fortunes, both good and bad, are pushed to their extremes in the area.  
	Recognizing the dangers of such an aberration the aquatic elves left the area.  It did not take long for groups of greedy humans and half orcs to realize the potential wealth to be made by such a place.  The region took on a deep propensity towards gambling, many casinos and other such “recreational” institutions were opened, and the port of “Lady's Love” was born.  
	A particularly fanatical cult of Bahamut has in the past few years taken it upon themselves to cleanse “Lady's Love” of its vices.  Moving into the area religious fanatics, some well-meaning good people, and all the sell swords this brand of Bahamut worship could purchase, have occupied the city and driven out the casinos, brothels and other places that could be connected to vice.  Many of the former gangsters have moved their casinos onto gigantic barges just off the shore of “Lady's Love”, newly renamed “Bahamut's Grace” by the conquerors, as a symbol of defiance.  While it is certainly more difficult to gamble as it once was, those who are truly interested can find the means to reach the pleasure barges the rulers of “Bahamut's Grace” seek to blockade.   
	Interestingly enough the half-orc slayer “Rendar” has joined the crusade to purge “Lady's Love”.  He is conflicted over whether such a quest has been motivated by a true devotion to Bahamut or a lower urge to simply control and rule others however.</content>

      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">*New Haven*
_The walls continue to rise as more and more people come each day.  Shops are opening and the streets are crowded with people from near and far.  A familiar face rides in on a large horse and approaches Lomian._
Gauthak arrives.  When the characters meet Quinn or leave the gate, Astrid approaches.  Quinn tells the PCs about the path underneath the mountains and that the old party found the Scroll of the Stars there.  

*Journey North*
Stallcroft appears very quiet and dark.  Neither Oaklord nor Holly are at home.  
_The path opens up wide into a flowing green valley set before towering, snow-capped peaks.  You notice that many animals roam the valley while a few hawks watch from above.  Your path takes you directly into the mountains and then banks left.  The air grows thin as the path rises into the mountains.  Make an endurance check (DC 26)_

_You find the overlook that Quinn was talking about.  A large stone sits against the mountainside beneath two large trees.  Words are in elven.  It reads:
"In daytime I lie pooled about,
At night I cloak like mist,
I creep inside coffins and 
Inside your tightened fist.
You see me best when you cannot see,
For I do not exist._

When the PCs get the answer in elven, _The stone begins to shake along with the ground.  The words light up as the stone retreats into the ground and it opens a set of stairs leading down into darkness._

*Ansis's Palace of Stars*
_This room is dark and colder than the rest.  Bookshelves line the walls and behind a desk you notice a small set of stairs leading upwards.  A chest sits in the room with an inscription on it in supernal.  It reads, "…and as they shine from the heavens, they reveal the magnificent power within. Each and every one reveals the secrets they have withheld over a thousand lifetimes. Seemingly fixed, they watch over this world and all others. Their power surpasses all understanding._  When one says "Stars" in supernal, the chest opens.  _The chest flies open, revealing a dark orb filled with stars.  The orb begins to expand until you are all engulfed.  Darkness and distant stars surround you as you fly through time and space.  Then suddenly, the orb shrinks once more back into the chest and you find yourselves in a grand hall, staring down a giant._  He only speaks giant or supernal.  He leads the characters into the next room.  

_This room is filled with small stars as if you were walking through the night sky.  A figure in a black cloak adorned with dark blue symbols stands staring out the far window.  Small lights hover around his head.  "Speak your names, creatures of the Fold._

*Misty Kingdom/Gate Post*
_The Hedrol mountains glisten as a backdrop to the green land before you.  Lush green hillsides flank the beautiful city of Asalia.  But hundreds of tents surround the city and are concentrated at the main gate._

*Asalia/Hedrol Gate*
_Asalia is the definition of pure beauty.  Perfectly formed stone streets lead between the buildings that sit upon the hillsides.  The glistening castle Heroldi rises above the rest, standing atop its own mountain overlooking the city below.  A strange purple glow emanates from it.  The only people in the streets are carrying large stones._  Citizens just say, "The stones," or "Bring the stones" and their eyes are glazed over with a purple color.
Hedrol Gate
_The stone streets turn to a finely cut grass as you near the large gate before you, known as the Hedrol Gate.  A lush courtyard with a rushing fountain sits before the large gate.  A cloaked man stands at the gate flanked by 2 guards on either side.  Glowing purple eyes peer out from underneath his hood._  "Return home," and "Leave these walls," are the only things he says before he draws his obsidian sword and attacks.  
(Wooden doors are locked in the courtyard.  The wooden doors in the streets are unlocked.  Behind locked doors are some treasures while behind the unlocked doors the PCs basically find a crime scene.)

*Castle Heroldi/Flay Nicely!*

      <content gm_only="true" format="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Haven&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The walls continue to rise as more and more people come each day.  Shops are opening and the streets are crowded with people from near and far.  A familiar face rides in on a large horse and approaches Lomian.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gauthak arrives.  When the characters meet Quinn or leave the gate, Astrid approaches.  Quinn tells the PCs about the path underneath the mountains and that the old party found the Scroll of the Stars there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journey North&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Stallcroft appears very quiet and dark.  Neither Oaklord nor Holly are at home.  &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The path opens up wide into a flowing green valley set before towering, snow-capped peaks.  You notice that many animals roam the valley while a few hawks watch from above.  Your path takes you directly into the mountains and then banks left.  The air grows thin as the path rises into the mountains.  Make an endurance check (DC 26)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You find the overlook that Quinn was talking about.  A large stone sits against the mountainside beneath two large trees.  Words are in elven.  It reads:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;In daytime I lie pooled about,&lt;br /&gt;
At night I cloak like mist,&lt;br /&gt;
I creep inside coffins and &lt;br /&gt;
Inside your tightened fist.&lt;br /&gt;
You see me best when you cannot see,&lt;br /&gt;
For I do not exist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the PCs get the answer in elven, &lt;em&gt;The stone begins to shake along with the ground.  The words light up as the stone retreats into the ground and it opens a set of stairs leading down into darkness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ansis&amp;#8217;s Palace of Stars&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This room is dark and colder than the rest.  Bookshelves line the walls and behind a desk you notice a small set of stairs leading upwards.  A chest sits in the room with an inscription on it in supernal.  It reads, &amp;quot;…and as they shine from the heavens, they reveal the magnificent power within. Each and every one reveals the secrets they have withheld over a thousand lifetimes. Seemingly fixed, they watch over this world and all others. Their power surpasses all understanding.&lt;/em&gt;  When one says &amp;#8220;Stars&amp;#8221; in supernal, the chest opens.  &lt;em&gt;The chest flies open, revealing a dark orb filled with stars.  The orb begins to expand until you are all engulfed.  Darkness and distant stars surround you as you fly through time and space.  Then suddenly, the orb shrinks once more back into the chest and you find yourselves in a grand hall, staring down a giant.&lt;/em&gt;  He only speaks giant or supernal.  He leads the characters into the next room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This room is filled with small stars as if you were walking through the night sky.  A figure in a black cloak adorned with dark blue symbols stands staring out the far window.  Small lights hover around his head.  &amp;quot;Speak your names, creatures of the Fold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misty Kingdom/Gate Post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Hedrol mountains glisten as a backdrop to the green land before you.  Lush green hillsides flank the beautiful city of Asalia.  But hundreds of tents surround the city and are concentrated at the main gate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asalia/Hedrol Gate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Asalia is the definition of pure beauty.  Perfectly formed stone streets lead between the buildings that sit upon the hillsides.  The glistening castle Heroldi rises above the rest, standing atop its own mountain overlooking the city below.  A strange purple glow emanates from it.  The only people in the streets are carrying large stones.&lt;/em&gt;  Citizens just say, &amp;#8220;The stones,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Bring the stones&amp;#8221; and their eyes are glazed over with a purple color.&lt;br /&gt;
Hedrol Gate&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The stone streets turn to a finely cut grass as you near the large gate before you, known as the Hedrol Gate.  A lush courtyard with a rushing fountain sits before the large gate.  A cloaked man stands at the gate flanked by 2 guards on either side.  Glowing purple eyes peer out from underneath his hood.&lt;/em&gt;  &amp;#8220;Return home,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Leave these walls,&amp;#8221; are the only things he says before he draws his obsidian sword and attacks.  &lt;br /&gt;
(Wooden doors are locked in the courtyard.  The wooden doors in the streets are unlocked.  Behind locked doors are some treasures while behind the unlocked doors the PCs basically find a crime scene.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castle Heroldi/Flay Nicely!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The wondrous ivory towers of the castle rise into the blue sky atop their mountain perch.  The strange glow still surrounds the structure and it appears a cave-in has occurred near the main entrance.  The stones fell from a high platform and form a sort of accidental staircase up to that spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hall you land in rises up at least 30 feet before ending in a vault.  Marble floors reflect the sunlight the enters in through the large windows.  A set of doors stands before you and down the hall you notice large statues flanking a partially open set of doors.  Once inside, you also feel vulnerable to a strange, and foreign power.

Cost for couriers to spread word of Games: 100Gp

"Tithes" to Blackstone estate to prevent king's interest in Games: 100,000Gp

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">The Kasaldabon is an extremely powerful crystal shard that is located somewhere in the southern half of The Fold.  Though it looks like just an average shard of red crystal, it is actually a petrified heart of a Deva.  The Deva it is said to have belonged to traveled throughout The Fold for thousands of years.  The Deva never died from wounds or being felled in battle.  This particular Deva was very knowledgeable of the world, spending all of his time reading and exploring.  He is said to have been the wisest being (besides the gods) to have ever lived.  One day while exploring The Fold an army happened upon him and tortured him to try and get him to spill information about an opposing army in the north.  The Deva would not speak of the matter, so the general from the army carved out his heart.  They put the heart in a bag of holding and carried it into battle.  With the heart, the general felt like he had received some sort of "Blessing from the gods."  But the truth is, with the heart near, his intelligence of battle strategy had improved.  The heart gave off an aura of different types of intelligence that had been studied by the Deva.  Once the general returned home, he locked the heart away.  One night, a group of thieves sneaked into his home and stole his fortune, but when they left, decided to burn down the house...with the heart locked inside of it.  The heart crystalized and was left in the wreckage.  When cleaning up the wreck, the heart was tossed aside, mistaken for a decorative item.  It hasn't been seen since.  It is said that one can hold the heart up to their own, and absorb the crystal and gain permanent knowledge of all the Deva knew...</content>

*1.	History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
a.	Founded by the Dragonborn, House of Medrazh in 10 A.N.&lt;br /&gt;
b.	Oldest city in Arna&lt;br /&gt;
c.	Built to fortify the mouth of the river from the ocean&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;2.	City Layout/Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
a.	Defenses&lt;br /&gt;
i.	Built with two forts on either side of the river, built on two hills. The forts are then joined by a fortified skywalk called the “brow of Bahamut”&lt;br /&gt;
ii.	Between the two forts are two sets of chains, referred to as “Bahamut’s Teeth” In times of war, both chains are raised, blocking passage into the harbor&lt;br /&gt;
iii.	Surrounding the city is a wall of pure Obsidian.  It is said that the blocks of obsidian were melded together by Bahamut himself thus creating the smoothness of the walls.&lt;br /&gt;
iv.	The river is lined with obsidian, causing erosion to be of no concern.&lt;br /&gt;
b.	Districts&lt;br /&gt;
i.	Military District&lt;br /&gt;
1.	The walled area immediately surrounding the forts&lt;br /&gt;

2.	Where the wealthy and noble class live&lt;br /&gt;
iii.	Old Town&lt;br /&gt;
1.	You can find most of the taverns and smith shops in old town&lt;br /&gt;
2.	Middle and lower class live here, depending on what side of the river you are on.&lt;br /&gt;
c.	Architecture&lt;br /&gt;
i.	Architecture is mainly based off of the Old Medrazh (Far Eastern)&lt;br /&gt;
ii.	Golden Dragons adorn most buildings, and it is considered a mark of good fortune to have the 7 dragons painted above your door&lt;br /&gt;
iii.	All timber is imported from Pelagahir and then painted Red, the color of Karathport&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3.	Customs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The war in Maransa has taken an unfortunate turn.  Just as King Tristan Blackstone reached the western edge and conquered Arna, Maransa unleashed terror upon the battlefield with the appearance of a red dragon.  Blackstone's army continues to see victory in many battles but when the dragon is involved, they are not so lucky.  

Kraenage is currently under siege from Blackstone's forces out of Arna.  Maransa has pulled many forces from the Bleeding Edge but Blackstone refuses to reduce his presence there.  

Blackstone has thus far failed to reach [[Maetrage | Maetrage]] although he has made many attempts.  The force remains strongest around the Jewel in the Sand.  The dragon's presence is also strongest in the surrounding area of the city.  The war is anyone's to claim up to this point but unless the dragon is handled...it will soon become apparent that it is already over.</content>

Blackstone&amp;#8217;s army continues to see victory in many battles but when the dragon is involved, they are not so lucky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kraenage is currently under siege from Blackstone&amp;#8217;s forces out of Arna.  Maransa has pulled many forces from the Bleeding Edge but Blackstone refuses to reduce his presence there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone has thus far failed to reach &lt;a href="/wikis/maetrage" class="wiki-page-link"&gt; Maetrage&lt;/a&gt; although he has made many attempts.  The force remains strongest around the Jewel in the Sand.  The dragon&amp;#8217;s presence is also strongest in the surrounding area of the city.  The war is anyone&amp;#8217;s to claim up to this point but unless the dragon is handled&amp;#8230;it will soon become apparent that it is already over.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">In the early days of Aedylor, Kymma Hlothran took it upon herself to raise the money and build a sewer system to dispose of the city's waste.  Gold was gathered from wealthy donors, intermittent taxes, and unknown sources.  It was always quite surprising how she managed to get the money.  Many said that she had very little but paid peasants and the poor to dig the tunnels as cheap labor.  
Midway through, Kymma vanished and the project was abandoned.  Various caverns and corridors exist within this abandoned sewer system.  

The current waste disposal system is a much more efficient working of small passageways the lead in and around the old system.  The old system became known simply as the Waste.  It maintains a horrendous smell of sewage and no light to speak of.  [[The Wandering Waste]] is rumored to be a group of the poor that live in these old tunnels and caverns.  </content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">The sickly individuals of the Wandering Waste are a pale and poor lot.  With no wealth to speak of, those who join must bring with them everything they own and give it up to the [[:the-wanderer | The Wanderer]].

Most people of the Wandering Waste are thin and sickly as if they have not eaten in some time.  They are usually a grossly pale color as well for the lack of sunlight in the sewers.  Their eyes grow wide always wandering in the darkness.  

Some who join the Wandering Waste succumb to disease and death rather quickly when being exposed to waste and disease within the sewers.  It is said that they eat rats and experiment with sewer water and fungi to live off of. 

One fateful night, soldiers from the castle stormed the Waste, attempting to rid the old sewers of the dwellers within.  Deep into the night they were forced to retreat.  Some say that the Wanderer cursed them with death and disease.  Others say it was the Waste itself.  A small few even say that the Wanderer saved the surviving soldiers from the Waste.  No matter the truth, the Waste has been left alone since.</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Chigaru was brought into this world after the Dawn Wars.  He was sent to Shady Vale to bring peace and to further the peoples religious understanding.  For hundreds of years he served and led this Convent, furthering his knowledge of the world and the way things are therein.  His body was broken in a dispute with a young ambitious and cunning Goliath named Ironfist who sought that peaceful country for his own.  Chigaru was reborn in the wild...unworthy of another Holy Birth.  He put forth all efforts to return to Shady Vale and kill Ironfist.  On his blood-march Chigaru's wrath built, on this march something snapped, he had changed.  When he reached Shady Vale, it was in ruin.  The once great South Road was little more than a dirt path now, the village was in disarray, the once bustling town seemed dead.  The anger rose inside Chigaru, with a roar loud enough to challenge the Gods themselves he called out Ironfist.  The fight was short, Ironfist stood no chance against the wrath that was set upon him.  Chigaru tore the corpse to pieces hacking and flesh until there was bone and blood.  Horrified at what he had become, the villagers, who were once his friends and pupils, cast him out.  Chigaru wandered the world that used to be so full of life...alone.  For days he walked, days turned to months, months turned to years, years turned into lifetimes.  Until he was reborn in a familiar place, except all life had gone from it, wandering the streets he came to the Church, upon entering he sees a solitary man in the front pew, praying.  When Chigaru got close enough he saw this man was gravely injured and beyond medical help.  The man saw Chigaru and wept, he had been praying to the Gods that the Teacher would return, and so he had.  The man explained that the village had been set upon in the night by demons who took all souls save his away, all the man heard was screaming fading into the distance.  The man had hoped that Chigaru would return so that Shady Vale could be at peace. And now that Chigaru had returned...the man looked up into Chigaru's eyes and smiled, and with that passed into the eternal slumber.  Chigaru buried the man, and with that vowed to set his life into avenging this place of knowledge, of light...his home.
Chigaru the priest was no more.  From this point on he is Chigaru the Avenger.  Setting forth from that place he struck North for 4 days, and on the 5th day found himself caught in a raging storm.  While seeking shelter he came across two people.  A Tiefling, and a Human.  Chigaru felt a touch of destiny around him and his new companions...what they will do in the months to come will shake the foundations of the earth and put the cosmos into motion.

An ancient dragon named Widera-Kalrunn embodied himself into a gnome near the end of his ancient life.  As a direct follower of Bahamut he carries out important tasks in the end of his new life.  He did start as a bard wishing to experience the human condition.  </content>

Starfire is NOT the heir to the Nerathi Empire.  He planted that idea based on some old translations of tomes regarding the Empire that he found in Brightkeep.  He has certain scholars speaking of "Starfire" and how he is the heir to the Nerathi Empire.  This is just his plan to keep the focus in the world and away from Hestavar.  Starfall is also a distraction.  

Starfire is fully aware of the war and its goings-on.  He is also aware of Iosphael.  He must continue his work to protect the world from the wrath of the star dragon.  

The "Starfire" in Nerath is actually a warforged construct of Erathis.  An illusion spell makes it look like a real person.

Starfire is essentially David Xanatos mixed with the Dread Pirate Roberts.  He became the "Dread Pirate Roberts" which uses the name Starfire after his predecessor (Oaklord) retired.  

Starfire is the name given to the chosen one who will carry out the task of creating the Eye of Time. This artifact is one of the most complex of Erathis’s Game of Making. Heroes have been attempting to stop Starfire for hundreds of years.

A small coin, with a star wreathed in flame. A scroll at the bedside:
 
Stars. Points of light in the darkest voids of time. Distant memories capturing all eternity. In the void, they watch us; fire under a human sky. Silent guardians of truth and as they shine from the heavens, they reveal the magnificent power within. Each and every one reveals the secrets they have withheld over a thousand lifetimes. Seemingly fixed, they watch over this world and all others. Their power surpasses all understanding. 
Until now. Many have come before and many will come after. But now it is you. You are the fire underneath the starry sky. Harness their power. Reform the lattice. Make the Game, Starfire.

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Weapons were not, strictly speaking, allowed during the Festival of the Sun. The celebration of the summer solstice was a time of joy and dancing and singing in praise of Pelor. And in his honor, no sword could be raised or bow strung. Any quarrel must be set aside. As a Protector of the Realm though, Thalion felt he could get away with the simple short sword hanging at his side. The comforting weight anchored him as the crowd of elves flowed around him and danced beneath the soaring expanse of the Temple of Giants. 
Twelve trees made up the Temple—a gift from the Fey over a thousand years ago. Now they rose three-hundred feet in the air, their bark the color of old blood as though the beating heart of the Feywild had been exposed. The branches arching overhead held the sun. And between each massive trunk, cleverly woven vines told the story of the world; their flowers laced and luminous like the stained glass found in the cathedrals of Men.
Thalion stood below a depiction of the sea at night—pale hibiscus scattered across a clematis sky—remembering when he was younger and often imagined a Corsair ship sailing those waves of wisteria. Behind him, the singing and laughing of the Elves did not penetrate the solemn silence of the Giants towering above them, and to Thalion the scene was distant and muted as the flickerings of fish underwater, mouths opening and closing without sound.
“Envinyatar.”
The familiar voice drew Thalion from his thoughts as he turned to see Longshanks standing beside a dark-haired Elf in rich robes of gold. “May I introduce Saif, cleric of Pelor. He has recently returned from a survey of the Astral Seas” Longshanks said with a slight bow, “Saif, this is Envinyatar, our newest Protector.”
Thalion smiled politely and nodded in greeting. He hadn’t needed Longshanks to tell him that the newcomer was a cleric or that he’d been travelling. And judging from the partially healed scar under Saif’s right eye, the journey had not been uneventful. The cleric stood with a familiar tension, left hand lightly gripped, and Thalion didn’t need to see the calluses to know the hand was used to holding a quarterstaff. Something stirred in Thalion’s memory: a rumor, a name spoken in hushed tones: Starfire. He opened his mouth to ask what news Saif brought from outside the Realm, but the cleric spoke first.
“A half-human?” 
Thalion stiffened at the low voice laced with contempt. His right hand tightened reflexively on his sword hilt. Saif looked from him to Longshanks as if waiting for the punch line, a sharp little smile on his face. “You’re not serious?” the cleric said, his laughter like ice thrown on a fire.
Once again all sound seemed sucked from the room. Thalion felt a nervous thrill amongst the crowd, saw embarrassed smiles flicked his way, but no one spoke. And in their eyes he saw the pity of an adult for a child who will never measure up. He looked to Longshanks, but the older elf’s gaze was focused somewhere over his head. Thalion knew he had to leave before he made the terrible faux pas of beheading a cleric of Pelor during the Festival of the Sun. “If you’ll excuse me,” he said and strode from the temple, blood pounding in his ears.

Thalion shifted his weight as he lifted the greatsword. It was not his normal weapon—the pommel did not provide adequate counterbalance for the long blade and so swings easily became wild and uncontrollable. He had learned to keep his arms close and use his own weight to offset the blade. He positioned the sword over his right shoulder in the classic telda guard and then sliced the blade diagonally downwards in a powerful arma hew. And then he was off, in the only dance he knew well, and in his hands the unbalanced blade flashed and struck as perfectly as the most finely crafted weapon. Longshanks’ words echoed through him: “A true master can make even the crudest blade sing.  A poor sword is no excuse for poor swordplay.”
When he was 14 and just starting his apprenticeship with the bladesmaster, Longshanks had refused to allow Thalion any weapon of quality. “Why should you use a blade finer than yourself?” He’d been forced to use falchions with broken grips, shorts swords with bent cross-guards. Some blades were dull or so crudely made they didn’t even have a fuller. And he had learned to use them all expertly. And even though Longshanks had long since deemed him worthy enough to use a true Elvin sword, Thalion still practiced with the broken blades, the poor imitations. They were difficult and took more care and thought to wield.
As he brought the greatsword down into a fool’s guard, he was startled by a light step, and looked up to see Groth step into the clearing. The sun had fallen low while Thalion practiced, and the shadows of the surrounding trees drew close. There was no telling how long the Eladrin monk had been watching. As always, he looked like he stepped from the air itself.
“You do dishonor to the day,” he said.
Thalion growled and threw down his sword. “Damn the day!”
“Envinyatar,” Groth rebuked sharply.
“Envinyatar, Telcontar, Thalion…why do you bother? There is no name you can give me that will make them forget I’m a half-elf. Half-human,” he said.
“You were never ashamed before.”
Thalion moved so swiftly Groth blinked but did not step back when the young half-elf stopped a mere foot from him and hissed, “I’m not ashamed.”
Groth sighed. “It has been many years since you let such thoughtless words bother you. The names, the slurs—yes they can be hurtful—but they are only words. They have only the power you give them. You know this. Who then are you angry at?”
“I forgot,” Thalion whispered. He waited for Groth to speak, but the other remained silent, and Thalion forced himself to continue, “I was too complacent. I let myself believe that being made a Protector of the Realm,” he couldn’t help the sneer that entered his voice as he spat out the now meaningless title, “meant I was accepted,  so when that condescending bastard threw my parentage in my face...” Thalion bit back the rest. His voice had risen to a shout, and he forced himself to take a deep breath before continuing at a more normal volume. “I just—I forgot how quickly the laughter and smiles can turn to mockery, and I wasn’t prepared to deal with it. Not today.” He had let his guard down and so had been unable to parry the unexpected blows. Longshanks would be ashamed of him—perhaps that’s why his old instructor had looked away. Thalion pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes against the headache beginning to pound in his right temple. “I’m such a fool.”
Groth did not disagree.
“Why?” Thalion asked when the silence became too much, when he no longer cared how childish he sounded.
The Eladrin hesitated, and Thalion feared for a moment that the monk would step back and vanish into the forest. “You cannot understand,” Groth said at last, “what they—what I—see when we look at you. You are so young and yet already a quarter of your life is spent.” The sun had gone in, and around them the night creatures of the forest were waking. Groth paused, apparently listening to the low, mournful hoot of an owl, before he added softly, “You are dying in front of me.”
Thalion flinched back as if struck. He could no longer meet Groth’s eyes. “You will die too,” he said, “they will all die.”
“Yes, we will die. We are not immortal. But our deaths will not come for hundreds of years. How many years do you have left? Fifty? So little time for the investment of one’s heart. We are not all as brave as your mother, who risked not only watching your father grow old and die but her children and her children’s children. Many would call it a mercy that she died when she did.”
“Mercy!”
Groth met Thalion’s furious glare without flinching. “Yes, mercy. She was saved from great pain. If you lost your parents a thousand times over, you would only begin to understand that pain. The dread of unavoidable loss over and over again, that would taint deepest love—that is what the Elves fear and what they see in you. Forgive them.”
Thalion turned his back on the Eladrin. His hands clenched and unclenched at his sides. He could forgive their fear.  He could not forgive their cowardice.
“You will have to learn to control this anger, Thalion. It is easy to show compassion and understanding for those like ourselves. But you will have to deal with the petty, the vindictive, and the fearful and not turn away. The sun does not rise for the good and just alone. Pelor’s light shines on all.”
“If someone was in need, I would help. I’m able to separate my personal feelings from—“
“And if that ‘someone’ was a Drow?” Groth interrupted.
Thalion’s mouth snapped shut. He could feel Groth’s gaze on the back of his neck.
“As I thought,” the monk said quietly. “There is a raven for you.”
“What?” Thalion said, whirling around. The clearing was empty. He scanned the skies, the trees for any sign of black wings. It was a raven that brought the news of his father’s death at the hands of the Drow—a raven that carried the news of his mother’s accident. Always ravens—hateful and monstrous like shreds of Death’s own cloak torn and scattered in her wake.
Finally, his eyes found the dread shape. The bird perched on a low branch at the edge of the circle of trees. And for a moment, nothing moved but the eye of the raven. The silver capsule fixed to one scaly leg glimmered like a bit of starlight.
Thalion forced himself to approach the bird, forced his hands not to shake as he unhooked the capsule and unfurled the note from within. It was from Chigaru—he was going to die. But for a Deva, death was cheap. Thalion’s heart started beating again. The raven flew away.

* _“How many times have you died?” he asked and then winced at his own lack of tact. He felt his face heat and looked away afraid of the rebuke he knew he would find in the Deva’s eyes. But Chigaru only laughed, a soft sound like the shifting of sand, and Thalion found the courage to look up.
“A better question,” Chigaru said, “would be ‘How many times have you lived?’ We Deva do not die as mortals do. I have little knowledge of Death or the dreams of eternal sleep. Dying, now… I know something of dying.” Thalion opened his mouth to interrupt, to ask…but Chigaru held up his hand. His dark eyes grew distant, and when he continued, his voice was ancient and remote as the stars: “My eyes close and open again. Death is a mere blink. At times, I feel I’ve never slept.”
The bitterness in the Deva’s voice caused Thalion to grit his teeth. “You would prefer to stay dead?” he bit out, heart racing. The old instinct to fight and keep fighting rose inside him, though what there was to fight against he didn’t know. The glade remained peaceful and quiet.
Chigaru smiled sadly. “You are angry with me. It is…understandable. You have only one life to live and are beginning to feel its brevity. The Raven Queen stands ever at your back. But Thalion,” Chigaru leaned forward and seized the half-elf’s hands, gripping them tightly, “mortality is not a weakness. Your father did not fail anymore than…”
Thalion wrenched his hands away and stood. “What does my father have to do with anything?” he hissed. He did not understand how his thoughtless question had descended into this.
“He died.”
Thalion crossed his arms and glared. He wondered how that purple skin would bruise.
Chigaru had become very still: a shadow among shadows. When he spoke, his white teeth slashed through the gloom like a knife blade. “Thalion, I know you better than I’ve allowed myself to know anyone for a long time. And I know you will not listen to anything I say now. But hear this at least: when you battle, do not fight Death—she is not your enemy. And do not envy the immortal. Our lives are a continuous waking into new worlds and different sunrises without even the memory of dreams.”_
Thalion shook off the shadows of that last conversation with difficulty. Chigaru had always been able to see through him and throw him off balance. The Deva even had the gall to claim Thalion was following the wrong god. “You value courage above compassion, Thalion, do not deny it.” Whenever Chigaru signed his letters (even ones asking Thalion to go on dark and dangerous journeys), there was always a mocking quality to his parting line, and Thalion saw this note was no exception: May Pelor protect you.*


Pelor didn't.


At the Garden of the Graves Thalion almost lost his soul...his being.


* _“The only mercy is a sharp blade and a strong arm.” His father’s voice—close, so close he should be able to see the speaker, feel the breath of his words. Thalion tried to lift his head, the metallic tang of blood thick in his mouth, but his body no longer obeyed his commands. All was darkness and the suffocating silence of the Heart. The voice may well have risen from his very bones.
“I am the flame and the fire and the sun.” His own voice now, harsh and jeering. Thalion watched the darkness coalesce before him and out stepped the Other from before, his other self. But not a perfect double this time. His doppelganger’s smile was unnaturally wide, showing more teeth than a mouth should hold, and it walked with a jerky, twitching step as if its knees were broken and bent backwards as easily as forwards now. Its arms dangled limply at its sides. The mouth didn’t move when it spoke: “The light of all lights and of all lights, one.”
Thalion’s sword lay beneath his right hand, but his fingers refused to close. His breath rattled in his chest as he struggled for purchase, and the Other scuttled closer. It was breathing in time with him, amplifying his own panting breaths into something indecent and sinister.
“You wish to spread Pelor’s light to the darkest places of the world,” it said through immobile lips, “but have never dared shine that light into the darkest reaches of your heart.” The Other’s neck bent sharply to the left, snapping with a sickening crack, to lay its head on its shoulder. The grin never faltered. “Why would Pelor protect you?”
Sweat dripped down Thalion’s face and mingled with the blood pooling in his mouth, dribbling from his lips as he raised himself to his feet. His breath shuddered in his lungs like a death-rattle. His double watched, eyes mad and wide and full of raven wings. Thalion staggered, barely maintaining the grip on his sword. His limbs trembled weakly as a newborn’s. With a last, great effort, he managed to lift the sword of over his right shoulder. He met his Other’s eyes. “The only mercy,” Thalion whispered and brought the blade crashing down._*


Not shortly after, Thalion ran from his faith.  He was alone and stranded in a desert, and Kord came to him. Now he fights along side his brothers of The Faith. The Brotherhood of the Mountain. With his brother [[:shadow | Shadow]] by his side, Thalion seeks to find Starfire, and stop him.</content>

As he brought the greatsword down into a fool’s guard, he was startled by a light step, and looked up to see Groth step into the clearing. The sun had fallen low while Thalion practiced, and the shadows of the surrounding trees drew close. There was no telling how long the Eladrin monk had been watching. As always, he looked like he stepped from the air itself.&lt;br /&gt;
“You do dishonor to the day,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion growled and threw down his sword. “Damn the day!”&lt;br /&gt;
“Envinyatar,” Groth rebuked sharply.&lt;br /&gt;
“Envinyatar, Telcontar, Thalion…why do you bother? There is no name you can give me that will make them forget I’m a half-elf. Half-human,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;
“You were never ashamed before.”&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion moved so swiftly Groth blinked but did not step back when the young half-elf stopped a mere foot from him and hissed, “I’m not ashamed.”&lt;br /&gt;
Groth sighed. “It has been many years since you let such thoughtless words bother you. The names, the slurs—yes they can be hurtful—but they are only words. They have only the power you give them. You know this. Who then are you angry at?”&lt;br /&gt;
“I forgot,” Thalion whispered. He waited for Groth to speak, but the other remained silent, and Thalion forced himself to continue, “I was too complacent. I let myself believe that being made a Protector of the Realm,” he couldn’t help the sneer that entered his voice as he spat out the now meaningless title, “meant I was accepted,  so when that condescending bastard threw my parentage in my face&amp;#8230;” Thalion bit back the rest. His voice had risen to a shout, and he forced himself to take a deep breath before continuing at a more normal volume. “I just—I forgot how quickly the laughter and smiles can turn to mockery, and I wasn’t prepared to deal with it. Not today.” He had let his guard down and so had been unable to parry the unexpected blows. Longshanks would be ashamed of him—perhaps that’s why his old instructor had looked away. Thalion pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes against the headache beginning to pound in his right temple. “I’m such a fool.”&lt;br /&gt;
Groth did not disagree.&lt;br /&gt;
“Why?” Thalion asked when the silence became too much, when he no longer cared how childish he sounded.&lt;br /&gt;
The Eladrin hesitated, and Thalion feared for a moment that the monk would step back and vanish into the forest. “You cannot understand,” Groth said at last, “what they—what I—see when we look at you. You are so young and yet already a quarter of your life is spent.” The sun had gone in, and around them the night creatures of the forest were waking. Groth paused, apparently listening to the low, mournful hoot of an owl, before he added softly, “You are dying in front of me.”&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion flinched back as if struck. He could no longer meet Groth’s eyes. “You will die too,” he said, “they will all die.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Yes, we will die. We are not immortal. But our deaths will not come for hundreds of years. How many years do you have left? Fifty? So little time for the investment of one’s heart. We are not all as brave as your mother, who risked not only watching your father grow old and die but her children and her children’s children. Many would call it a mercy that she died when she did.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Mercy!”&lt;br /&gt;
Groth met Thalion’s furious glare without flinching. “Yes, mercy. She was saved from great pain. If you lost your parents a thousand times over, you would only begin to understand that pain. The dread of unavoidable loss over and over again, that would taint deepest love—that is what the Elves fear and what they see in you. Forgive them.”&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion turned his back on the Eladrin. His hands clenched and unclenched at his sides. He could forgive their fear.  He could not forgive their cowardice.&lt;br /&gt;
“You will have to learn to control this anger, Thalion. It is easy to show compassion and understanding for those like ourselves. But you will have to deal with the petty, the vindictive, and the fearful and not turn away. The sun does not rise for the good and just alone. Pelor’s light shines on all.”&lt;br /&gt;
“If someone was in need, I would help. I’m able to separate my personal feelings from—“&lt;br /&gt;
“And if that ‘someone’ was a Drow?” Groth interrupted.&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion’s mouth snapped shut. He could feel Groth’s gaze on the back of his neck.&lt;br /&gt;
“As I thought,” the monk said quietly. “There is a raven for you.”&lt;br /&gt;
“What?” Thalion said, whirling around. The clearing was empty. He scanned the skies, the trees for any sign of black wings. It was a raven that brought the news of his father’s death at the hands of the Drow—a raven that carried the news of his mother’s accident. Always ravens—hateful and monstrous like shreds of Death’s own cloak torn and scattered in her wake.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, his eyes found the dread shape. The bird perched on a low branch at the edge of the circle of trees. And for a moment, nothing moved but the eye of the raven. The silver capsule fixed to one scaly leg glimmered like a bit of starlight.&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion forced himself to approach the bird, forced his hands not to shake as he unhooked the capsule and unfurled the note from within. It was from Chigaru—he was going to die. But for a Deva, death was cheap. Thalion’s heart started beating again. The raven flew away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How many times have you died?” he asked and then winced at his own lack of tact. He felt his face heat and looked away afraid of the rebuke he knew he would find in the Deva’s eyes. But Chigaru only laughed, a soft sound like the shifting of sand, and Thalion found the courage to look up.&lt;br /&gt;
“A better question,” Chigaru said, “would be ‘How many times have you lived?’ We Deva do not die as mortals do. I have little knowledge of Death or the dreams of eternal sleep. Dying, now… I know something of dying.” Thalion opened his mouth to interrupt, to ask…but Chigaru held up his hand. His dark eyes grew distant, and when he continued, his voice was ancient and remote as the stars: “My eyes close and open again. Death is a mere blink. At times, I feel I’ve never slept.”&lt;br /&gt;
The bitterness in the Deva’s voice caused Thalion to grit his teeth. “You would prefer to stay dead?” he bit out, heart racing. The old instinct to fight and keep fighting rose inside him, though what there was to fight against he didn’t know. The glade remained peaceful and quiet.&lt;br /&gt;
Chigaru smiled sadly. “You are angry with me. It is…understandable. You have only one life to live and are beginning to feel its brevity. The Raven Queen stands ever at your back. But Thalion,” Chigaru leaned forward and seized the half-elf’s hands, gripping them tightly, “mortality is not a weakness. Your father did not fail anymore than…”&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion wrenched his hands away and stood. “What does my father have to do with anything?” he hissed. He did not understand how his thoughtless question had descended into this.&lt;br /&gt;
“He died.”&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion crossed his arms and glared. He wondered how that purple skin would bruise.&lt;br /&gt;
Chigaru had become very still: a shadow among shadows. When he spoke, his white teeth slashed through the gloom like a knife blade. “Thalion, I know you better than I’ve allowed myself to know anyone for a long time. And I know you will not listen to anything I say now. But hear this at least: when you battle, do not fight Death—she is not your enemy. And do not envy the immortal. Our lives are a continuous waking into new worlds and different sunrises without even the memory of dreams.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion shook off the shadows of that last conversation with difficulty. Chigaru had always been able to see through him and throw him off balance. The Deva even had the gall to claim Thalion was following the wrong god. “You value courage above compassion, Thalion, do not deny it.” Whenever Chigaru signed his letters (even ones asking Thalion to go on dark and dangerous journeys), there was always a mocking quality to his parting line, and Thalion saw this note was no exception: May Pelor protect you.*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelor didn&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Garden of the Graves Thalion almost lost his soul&amp;#8230;his being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The only mercy is a sharp blade and a strong arm.” His father’s voice—close, so close he should be able to see the speaker, feel the breath of his words. Thalion tried to lift his head, the metallic tang of blood thick in his mouth, but his body no longer obeyed his commands. All was darkness and the suffocating silence of the Heart. The voice may well have risen from his very bones.&lt;br /&gt;
“I am the flame and the fire and the sun.” His own voice now, harsh and jeering. Thalion watched the darkness coalesce before him and out stepped the Other from before, his other self. But not a perfect double this time. His doppelganger’s smile was unnaturally wide, showing more teeth than a mouth should hold, and it walked with a jerky, twitching step as if its knees were broken and bent backwards as easily as forwards now. Its arms dangled limply at its sides. The mouth didn’t move when it spoke: “The light of all lights and of all lights, one.”&lt;br /&gt;
Thalion’s sword lay beneath his right hand, but his fingers refused to close. His breath rattled in his chest as he struggled for purchase, and the Other scuttled closer. It was breathing in time with him, amplifying his own panting breaths into something indecent and sinister.&lt;br /&gt;
“You wish to spread Pelor’s light to the darkest places of the world,” it said through immobile lips, “but have never dared shine that light into the darkest reaches of your heart.” The Other’s neck bent sharply to the left, snapping with a sickening crack, to lay its head on its shoulder. The grin never faltered. “Why would Pelor protect you?”&lt;br /&gt;
Sweat dripped down Thalion’s face and mingled with the blood pooling in his mouth, dribbling from his lips as he raised himself to his feet. His breath shuddered in his lungs like a death-rattle. His double watched, eyes mad and wide and full of raven wings. Thalion staggered, barely maintaining the grip on his sword. His limbs trembled weakly as a newborn’s. With a last, great effort, he managed to lift the sword of over his right shoulder. He met his Other’s eyes. “The only mercy,” Thalion whispered and brought the blade crashing down.&lt;/em&gt;*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not shortly after, Thalion ran from his faith.  He was alone and stranded in a desert, and Kord came to him. Now he fights along side his brothers of The Faith. The Brotherhood of the Mountain. With his brother &lt;a href="/characters/shadow" class="wiki-content-link"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; by his side, Thalion seeks to find Starfire, and stop him.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
      <content gm_only="true" format="textile">Thalion likes to inflict damage.  He is an instigator/power gamer. </content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">For the past 10 years, Shadow has been the personal body guard of Kord.  Trained from a young age, the original home and name of Shadow is unknown.  When Kord's generals trained Shadow they removed all connections he had with his past and started anew.  Shadow is a war machine, built to protect his god and fight till his last breath.  He is not without fault though.  For the past two or three years, Shadow has begun asking questions about his past, however, no one in the heavens will answer his questions.

When Kord asked Shadow to return to the realm of the world, he could not refuse.  To serve one's god directly is the highest of honors.  Shadow had proven himself in the wars between Kord and Incabulos by single handedly pushing back the advances of Incabulos.  Some would say Kord thinks of Shadow as a son that never was.  

Blessed by Kord, Shadow returned to the realm of mortals.  When Starfire decided to harness a power that could rival the gods, Shadow was Kord's most devastating weapon to stop him.  Also, Shadow may be able to find something out about his past, for he does not remember anything from the age of 10 to his birth.  His parents and siblings are a mystery, as well as his homeland.  This quest may help in more ways than just aiding his god.

When arriving to the realm of mortals, Kord had restrained some of Shadow's power.  Shadow must not draw too much attention to himself or his party.  While Shadow proved himself during war, Kord was still eager to see what he was capable of.  Restraining his powers so that he may have a small challenge  will test Shadow's ability to adapt to situations, making him an even more formittable opponent.  

On the realm of mortals, Shadow was greeted by the party of Thalian, Three, and Argawane.  Three great warriors that the world had to offer.  Finding this to be a suitable party, Shadow ventured off.  Argawane was found to be a king, and split from the party to rule his kingdom.  The remaining three dove deep into the Tomb of Horrors (a place known for nothing but death and destruction) hoping to find answers to the wear-abouts of Starfire.  While in the tomb, Shadow developed a bond and friendship with his fellow companions.  Finding common ground with the two.  Though Three worships Haramathore, Shadow found it to be honorable that he was serving his god directly, a similar task given to Shadow.  Thalian was also a follower of Kord, in which Shadow found most welcoming.  The three came across a thief named Quinn, who was later revealed to be nothing more than a fellow adventurer, searching for more thrills, being as he was nearly 50 years old and had not been on an adventure in some time.  The party welcomed Quinn with open arms and went along.  The three were now four, and the four became known as The Gods' Chosen.

However, while in the tomb, the life of Thalian was taken from the party.  Devastated, Shadow said his prayers and sent Thalian off on a fairy, which was then ignited by a flame cast by Shadow's crossbow.  Attached to the bolt fired, was the ring that was on Thalian's finger, a ring that matched Shadow's ring of Kord.

h2. Post-Campaign

You roam Sigil for weeks. The city is massive. Finally, walking thru a market one day, an old woman approaches you, "Yarehl?" 

She motions you into a nearby home. The ceilings are low and the home is fairly dark. But the windows provide enough light that no candles are needed. She sits across the table from you and once again, she looks like the young fortune teller.

"Yarehl, what is it you seek?"

--------

Direction, choices.  I need to see my options so that I may know which path to take.

"A choice you have made. Clearly, you seek something more than serving in the courts of your god. For you are here. Not there."

--------

"I did not know if you were chosen by Kord to lead me somewhere more.  If I do not turn back for the gates, what is it that you would have of me?"

--------

"I follow no god. I can show you truths that they would deny. But you would never be the same. Knowing these, you would never become the Dawn Warrior."

--------

"And what of Rikka?  The Chosen?  The Citadel?  My friends?  Would this path lead me from all that?"

--------

"They do not rest along this path. You can choose to follow me or you can become the Dawn Warrior and keep your friends. It's a choice that only you can make."

--------

"Then I must bid you farewell.  Maybe another will follow your path."  
Shadow stands up, nods, and leaves. 

--------

Shadow ascends the steps of the Dawn Palace on Celestia. Each step taken, representative of the years of his journey. 

Inside the palace, the Messenger receives you. "Welcome, Warrior of the Dawn!" On that last word, he shouts and in an explosion of light, your armor ignites in flames. You see a beam of radiant light cast down before you. From above, a sword descends the funnel of light. As it comes to rest in your hands, the flames die out. 

You now wear the Dawn Warrior armor and wield the Dawn Warrior's Blade, both blessed by Kord himself. 

"You've proven yourself and saved these worlds from utter destruction but at a cost. We now have even more fearsome battles to fight. In the darkness, the chains have been broken."

--------

"What do you ask of me?"

--------

"The Starfire Calamity has greater consequences than we know. The world will be thrust into a darkness now like never before. It's only beginning. 

You must go to the world. Appear as nothing more than a mortal. There is a priest - a Brother Alphas Gladerion. Under cover of darkness, kill him. Prevent the next piece of this grand puzzle from falling. 

Once you've done this, do not return to the Dawn Palace but instead return to your true love. Live out your life. Kord will call upon you when you are needed again."

--------

As you command

--------

Sir, I must ask before I leave.  I have done all you requested, shall I lead your armies in the future? What is my full purpose for you? I suppose I am still confused

--------

"Our armies are no match for what is to come. Enjoy that which you haven't been able to...your life. When it is time for the Dawn Warrior to rise, maybe for the last time, you will be called."

--------

You don the clothes of a simple mortal, hiding who you really are. You travel to the world and a place known as the Dawn Sanctuary:

[[File:959764  | class=media-item-align-center | 22068923_965320788895_390605836_o.jpg]]

In the dark of night, you easily descend through an open window on one of the top floors. You move quietly down the marble hallway, beams of moonlight bathing the floor from each window. 

You enter the quarters at the end of the hallway. A priest is kneeling in prayer, strange runes inscribed on the floor around him. You know this is Brother Alphas Gladerion.

You summon and raise the Dawn Warrior's blade high above your head. He looks up slowly, meeting your eyes. Do you say anything? What do you do?

--------

"Why would my god wish you dead?"

--------

"I do not know you or your god. Am I to die, tonight?"

--------

"For what reason would one want you dead? What have you done that the afterlife calls you so urgently?"

--------

"There are deeper truths that we are only just discovering. I merely serve the people. Nothing more. They need protection now more than ever. Against men and gods. If you are to strike me down for that, so be it. I'm ready to go."

--------

"This is not the first I have heard of these truths.  Please, what do you speak of?

--------

His eyes glaze over momentarily. The color leaves them. Only dark orbs remain.

He smiles and very slowly starts to stand. He begins reciting something. "We are the keepers - the lore forbidden. Darkness eternal, chains now broken." As he rises, his chanting gets louder. "We are the keepers - the lore forbidden! Darkness eternal, chains now broken!" 

Almost fully standing now, he is shouting. "WE ARE THE KEEPERS - THE LORE FORBIDDEN. DARKNESS ETERNAL, CHAINS NOW BROKEN!" Midway through his recitation, he reaches into his cloak and pulls a knife. What do you do?

--------

Shadow quickly brings his sword down on the man's wrist as he pulls out the knife.  "What are you?"

--------

His eyes return to normal. A slight look of fear comes over him. “I am Brother Alphas Gladerion. Protector of the people.”

--------

"I am sorry, Brother."  Shadow ignites his blade and slashes it across gladerion's chest.  Then sheathes his blade.

--------

The priest falls and breathes no more. His remains lie in the circle of runes, no longer alight. The room is dark and cold. Completely silent. There is nothing more here.

--------

You return at long last to New Haven, the settlement rebuilt by the God's Chosen. Ricka Aldarion greets you and invites you into your new worldly home. 

For 11 years, you enjoy peace with Ricka. During the eleventh year, you receive a message. "The last piece has fallen. Now begins the rise of the Dawn Warrior." Without hesitation, you know where you must go. Though you do not expect to return. 

At the gates of New Haven is an army like no other, stretching across the hills for miles. All are emblazoned with the symbols and blessings of Kord. The Messenger waits with them. "Dawn Warrior, are you ready to lead us into the black? Our fate awaits us in the Abyss."
Before I go, I wish enough time to do one thing
As you wish

--------

Shadow's intent is one more night with Ricka.  So he may ensure that his bloodline continue.  

Before he sets out and leaves his family behind.  He leaves a message with Ricka, asking her to raise our eventual child.  Also, he leaves instructions to contact Three, Baurus, Vengeance, and Chigaru to inform them of where he is to depart to.

      <content gm_only="true" format="html">&lt;p&gt;Loves doing damage and loves treasure.  Magic items are best.  His past name might be Yarehl (Ya-rell).  An old woman may recognize him one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-Campaign&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You roam Sigil for weeks. The city is massive. Finally, walking thru a market one day, an old woman approaches you, &amp;#8220;Yarehl?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She motions you into a nearby home. The ceilings are low and the home is fairly dark. But the windows provide enough light that no candles are needed. She sits across the table from you and once again, she looks like the young fortune teller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yarehl, what is it you seek?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direction, choices.  I need to see my options so that I may know which path to take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;A choice you have made. Clearly, you seek something more than serving in the courts of your god. For you are here. Not there.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I did not know if you were chosen by Kord to lead me somewhere more.  If I do not turn back for the gates, what is it that you would have of me?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I follow no god. I can show you truths that they would deny. But you would never be the same. Knowing these, you would never become the Dawn Warrior.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And what of Rikka?  The Chosen?  The Citadel?  My friends?  Would this path lead me from all that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They do not rest along this path. You can choose to follow me or you can become the Dawn Warrior and keep your friends. It&amp;#8217;s a choice that only you can make.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Then I must bid you farewell.  Maybe another will follow your path.&amp;#8221;  &lt;br /&gt;
Shadow stands up, nods, and leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadow ascends the steps of the Dawn Palace on Celestia. Each step taken, representative of the years of his journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the palace, the Messenger receives you. &amp;#8220;Welcome, Warrior of the Dawn!&amp;#8221; On that last word, he shouts and in an explosion of light, your armor ignites in flames. You see a beam of radiant light cast down before you. From above, a sword descends the funnel of light. As it comes to rest in your hands, the flames die out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You now wear the Dawn Warrior armor and wield the Dawn Warrior&amp;#8217;s Blade, both blessed by Kord himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;You&amp;#8217;ve proven yourself and saved these worlds from utter destruction but at a cost. We now have even more fearsome battles to fight. In the darkness, the chains have been broken.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What do you ask of me?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Starfire Calamity has greater consequences than we know. The world will be thrust into a darkness now like never before. It&amp;#8217;s only beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must go to the world. Appear as nothing more than a mortal. There is a priest &amp;#8211; a Brother Alphas Gladerion. Under cover of darkness, kill him. Prevent the next piece of this grand puzzle from falling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;#8217;ve done this, do not return to the Dawn Palace but instead return to your true love. Live out your life. Kord will call upon you when you are needed again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you command&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sir, I must ask before I leave.  I have done all you requested, shall I lead your armies in the future? What is my full purpose for you? I suppose I am still confused&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Our armies are no match for what is to come. Enjoy that which you haven&amp;#8217;t been able to&amp;#8230;your life. When it is time for the Dawn Warrior to rise, maybe for the last time, you will be called.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don the clothes of a simple mortal, hiding who you really are. You travel to the world and a place known as the Dawn Sanctuary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://db4sgowjqfwig.cloudfront.net/campaigns/27075/assets/959764/22068923_965320788895_390605836_o.jpg?1554551336" class="asset-reference image-asset-reference media-item-align-center" data-asset-id="959764"   alt="22068923_965320788895_390605836_o.jpg" title="22068923_965320788895_390605836_o.jpg"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the dark of night, you easily descend through an open window on one of the top floors. You move quietly down the marble hallway, beams of moonlight bathing the floor from each window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You enter the quarters at the end of the hallway. A priest is kneeling in prayer, strange runes inscribed on the floor around him. You know this is Brother Alphas Gladerion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You summon and raise the Dawn Warrior&amp;#8217;s blade high above your head. He looks up slowly, meeting your eyes. Do you say anything? What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Why would my god wish you dead?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I do not know you or your god. Am I to die, tonight?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For what reason would one want you dead? What have you done that the afterlife calls you so urgently?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There are deeper truths that we are only just discovering. I merely serve the people. Nothing more. They need protection now more than ever. Against men and gods. If you are to strike me down for that, so be it. I&amp;#8217;m ready to go.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is not the first I have heard of these truths.  Please, what do you speak of?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes glaze over momentarily. The color leaves them. Only dark orbs remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He smiles and very slowly starts to stand. He begins reciting something. &amp;#8220;We are the keepers &amp;#8211; the lore forbidden. Darkness eternal, chains now broken.&amp;#8221; As he rises, his chanting gets louder. &amp;#8220;We are the keepers &amp;#8211; the lore forbidden! Darkness eternal, chains now broken!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost fully standing now, he is shouting. &amp;#8220;WE &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEEPERS&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LORE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FORBIDDEN&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DARKNESS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETERNAL&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHAINS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOW&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BROKEN&lt;/span&gt;!&amp;#8221; Midway through his recitation, he reaches into his cloak and pulls a knife. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadow quickly brings his sword down on the man&amp;#8217;s wrist as he pulls out the knife.  &amp;#8220;What are you?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His eyes return to normal. A slight look of fear comes over him. “I am Brother Alphas Gladerion. Protector of the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am sorry, Brother.&amp;#8221;  Shadow ignites his blade and slashes it across gladerion&amp;#8217;s chest.  Then sheathes his blade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The priest falls and breathes no more. His remains lie in the circle of runes, no longer alight. The room is dark and cold. Completely silent. There is nothing more here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You return at long last to New Haven, the settlement rebuilt by the God&amp;#8217;s Chosen. Ricka Aldarion greets you and invites you into your new worldly home.&lt;/p&gt;

Aietius' work at Brightkeep Academy had been primarily to find ways to merge the powers of the Feywild with the more mundanely engineered projects of the world.  When Aietius caught word of Starfire's event at Brightkeep, Aietius set off to the Tomb of Horrors fearing that Starfire might pursue the powerful devices held within.  What Aietius intended to do with those devices in that fury was indeterminable, even to himself.

After hiring sell-swords and failing miserably in his first attempt to take the Tomb, Aietius resigned himself to the Skull Breakers and began constructing his identity entirely in terms of opposition to the horrendous place.  He took on the non-Eladrin Path of Light religion from one of his fellow Skullbreakers against the traditional Eladrin Court of Stars, and devoted himself to taking the mysteries at the core of the Tomb.  At this point, Aietius had become almost indifferent to Starfire's supposed machinations, Aietius simply wanted revenge on the Tomb that stole his naivety and sight.

      <title>Lomian Dawnshadow (R.I.P.)</title>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile"></content>
      <content gm_only="false" format="html"></content>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Lomian Dawnshadow is the only surviving member of his immediate family. The Dawnshadow's have been rulers of Arna since before the fall of the Nerathi Empire, until now. After their father's death, Lomian's brother Kale assumed the throne. As a boy he was greedy and quick to anger, upon the throne he was that and more. Kale made an allegiance with the sworn enemy of Arna, the Vampires in the Northern Mountains. He looked beyond Arna's borders to the east, and thirsted for all of Aestonia. He did not get far, Lomian had been organizing a resistance and all loyal to his father came to his side, he met Kale in the field of battle outside of Haran's gates. He brought Kale to Justice with his own sword. Lost in the emotion of it all, Lomian fled. He eventually found himself at Brightkeep , where they saw that he had a touch of destiny, and sent him back to Aestonia to meet the God's Chosen. Lomian established New Haven with the intention of having a place where refugees from all lands could feel safe, and as a base of operations for the God's Chosen.

In Lomian's absence, his Uncle has taken the throne and impatiently waits for Lomian's return.

h2. The Oath Breaker

Skin pale as a new borns, as is typical with Vryloka. Eyes a deep shade of blue, with flecks of silver as if his eyes were the sky at twilight. Long crimson hair turned white after the incident. Prince Lomian is built like a warrior, muscled and lean. However, he spends hours with his nose buried into books of Lore, concerning himself with the history of his ancestors and of the world. He would make a fine King one day, fate has other ideas.

Lomian, which means Son of Twilight in Sindarin (Tolkiens made up language haha), was of Noble birth. The second born son to the Good King who ruled the better part of half the realm of Arda it's Capitol being Eriador, far to the West of the Kingdom of Asalia. Upon his coming of age Lomian was given his own estate and garrison. Upon proving himself, he was invited to sit on his Father's court where he became a respected voice in The Realm. Rising to become "The Sword", a title held by the Commander of the personal guard of the King. One day, a strange man came to court. He wanted a personal audience with Lomian, not wanting to look the coward in his father's eyes Lomian had little choice in the matter. He entertained the stranger for the better portion of the day, listening to non-sense about the impending doom of The Realm and how a dark prince would step from underneath his father's shadow and enclose the Realm in an iron fist. Prince Lomian was having none of it. The Stranger had wasted half his day and the council was adjourned. Being a Vryloka, Lomian was quick to emotion and consequently, his anger. He dismissed the Stranger at once. Annoyed, the Stranger uttered a few queer words and extended his hard leather hand in thanks for the audience. As their hands met The Stranger fused his hand with the Prince's. Immediately the Prince felt powerful energy flowing through his body, wave after wave of pain racked his body for what seemed an eternity, but after a few short seconds the Stranger laughed and said, "you'll thank me. The Realm will thank me." and in a flash, he was gone and Prince Lomian fell into darkness. Weeks of dark and troubling dreams past before Lomian awoke in the dark. He was cold, and alone. Weeks more past as he recovered his strength and more. Somewhere deep inside him something was fighting to be let out...


For a long time The Realm was a place of peace. Caravans of travelers, singers, and merchants frequented The Road, until The Good King past away and his first son, Kale the Strong came into his power. It took only a few short weeks for Kale to displace his father's council with his own. Lomian's own Honor Guard were replaced with thugs, rapists, and thieves...chosen by Kale. Prince Lomian ran what he liked "the kennel" now, as his men were now merely Kale's dogs. It only took 3 changes of the moon for military power in the realm to double. The knights of the castle had taken to raping women in the streets, putting insubordinate citizens to the sword where the stood, and claiming whatever they could as their own. Lomian was beginning to see, the Stranger had the right of it. The Realm was crumbling in the Iron Fist of his brother Kale.
Kale, in the midst of one of his rages, decided he would take the Realm of the Vines for his own. The elves were after inferior, and his new kingdom needed slaves. Lomian argued with his older brother for days, it was not right to invade a non-warring colony. Kale would not hear it, and Lomian was forced to submit, however, Lomian began to conceive a plan.

As the sworn sword of the king, Lomian was to lead the Vanguard at the head of the army...the first into battle. Having the most dangerous task Lomian demanded from Kale that he pick every single man in the Vanguard. Not seeing any harm in this Kale agreed, and Lomian began to hand pick the only people who he could trust...those still claiming the ideals of his father, The Good King. They flew his banner, a Golden Eagle on a white field, and clad themselves all in white, symbolizing their purity from this new evil king. The rest of the men in Kales army flew a horrifying banner of a giant black bat with red eyes over a field of red. On the march a band of cloaked figures joined the King, these were emisarries from the Vryloka's cursed blood brothers...vampires. It appeared that Kale had made a pact with the cursed bloods. Lomian had no love for the Black Brothers and decided it was time hatch his plan, it was early, but recent events forced his hand. That night, Lomian took the Van and flew for The Realm of the Vines to warn them of the coming attack. As the elves of the wood began setting their defences, Lomian sped on towards Asalia to beg for men. The King (Antovian Hareldi... that is Antoban's great grand-father), touched by Lomian's courage, led the army out himself. Furthermore, he sent a raven to the dwarven colony in the mountains.

(Battle Scene)
Kale's force consisted of 25,000 foot and 7,500 horse with 1,000 vampire warriors.
Alliance of the Free Folk 15,000 elves on foot 5,000 men on foot with 2,500 horse and 2000 dwarven foot soldiers

In the middle of the fight Lomian cuts his way through the dark horde and finds Kale, giving in to the dark powers and feasting on a young elf's flesh. Lomian calls him out...EPIC FIGHT. Infuriated, Lomian unleashes a blast of Arcane energy and his blade seems to sear flesh on contact. Witnesses say they could see the Flame of Justice in his eyes and it burned through the Horde. Songs were sung of his deeds, but his new found power frightened him, and he fled that night into the forest. He saught guidance in one of the Septs and a Deva there, Chigaru if I recall, pointed him in the direction of Brightkeep within the Feywild. He was put under the guidance of a young Eladrin wizard who was a scholar at Brightkeep, his name was Aranil. Many years past and many years after that...and Aranil and Lomian, both immortals, grew together, grew STRONG together. In that time Lomian grew to harness his power and use it against his foes. The ancient powers bestowed upon him a wondrous blade. The Starshadow, when looked upon this longsword of shifting light and shadow appears as if someone made it by folding molten dreams and nightmares in the forge of a star. Now It was time that Lomian returned to Arna to install peace to the realm and it was during that time Aranil rose to the head of the order at brightkeep. Upon his return, Aranil had news for him...a group of would-be heroes is on a important quest that hold the fate of the world. The quest for starfire.</content>
      <content gm_only="false" format="html">&lt;p&gt;Lomian Dawnshadow is the only surviving member of his immediate family. The Dawnshadow&amp;#8217;s have been rulers of Arna since before the fall of the Nerathi Empire, until now. After their father&amp;#8217;s death, Lomian&amp;#8217;s brother Kale assumed the throne. As a boy he was greedy and quick to anger, upon the throne he was that and more. Kale made an allegiance with the sworn enemy of Arna, the Vampires in the Northern Mountains. He looked beyond Arna&amp;#8217;s borders to the east, and thirsted for all of Aestonia. He did not get far, Lomian had been organizing a resistance and all loyal to his father came to his side, he met Kale in the field of battle outside of Haran&amp;#8217;s gates. He brought Kale to Justice with his own sword. Lost in the emotion of it all, Lomian fled. He eventually found himself at Brightkeep , where they saw that he had a touch of destiny, and sent him back to Aestonia to meet the God&amp;#8217;s Chosen. Lomian established New Haven with the intention of having a place where refugees from all lands could feel safe, and as a base of operations for the God&amp;#8217;s Chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Lomian&amp;#8217;s absence, his Uncle has taken the throne and impatiently waits for Lomian&amp;#8217;s return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Oath Breaker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin pale as a new borns, as is typical with Vryloka. Eyes a deep shade of blue, with flecks of silver as if his eyes were the sky at twilight. Long crimson hair turned white after the incident. Prince Lomian is built like a warrior, muscled and lean. However, he spends hours with his nose buried into books of Lore, concerning himself with the history of his ancestors and of the world. He would make a fine King one day, fate has other ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lomian, which means Son of Twilight in Sindarin (Tolkiens made up language haha), was of Noble birth. The second born son to the Good King who ruled the better part of half the realm of Arda it&amp;#8217;s Capitol being Eriador, far to the West of the Kingdom of Asalia. Upon his coming of age Lomian was given his own estate and garrison. Upon proving himself, he was invited to sit on his Father&amp;#8217;s court where he became a respected voice in The Realm. Rising to become &amp;#8220;The Sword&amp;#8221;, a title held by the Commander of the personal guard of the King. One day, a strange man came to court. He wanted a personal audience with Lomian, not wanting to look the coward in his father&amp;#8217;s eyes Lomian had little choice in the matter. He entertained the stranger for the better portion of the day, listening to non-sense about the impending doom of The Realm and how a dark prince would step from underneath his father&amp;#8217;s shadow and enclose the Realm in an iron fist. Prince Lomian was having none of it. The Stranger had wasted half his day and the council was adjourned. Being a Vryloka, Lomian was quick to emotion and consequently, his anger. He dismissed the Stranger at once. Annoyed, the Stranger uttered a few queer words and extended his hard leather hand in thanks for the audience. As their hands met The Stranger fused his hand with the Prince&amp;#8217;s. Immediately the Prince felt powerful energy flowing through his body, wave after wave of pain racked his body for what seemed an eternity, but after a few short seconds the Stranger laughed and said, &amp;#8220;you&amp;#8217;ll thank me. The Realm will thank me.&amp;#8221; and in a flash, he was gone and Prince Lomian fell into darkness. Weeks of dark and troubling dreams past before Lomian awoke in the dark. He was cold, and alone. Weeks more past as he recovered his strength and more. Somewhere deep inside him something was fighting to be let out&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time The Realm was a place of peace. Caravans of travelers, singers, and merchants frequented The Road, until The Good King past away and his first son, Kale the Strong came into his power. It took only a few short weeks for Kale to displace his father&amp;#8217;s council with his own. Lomian&amp;#8217;s own Honor Guard were replaced with thugs, rapists, and thieves&amp;#8230;chosen by Kale. Prince Lomian ran what he liked &amp;#8220;the kennel&amp;#8221; now, as his men were now merely Kale&amp;#8217;s dogs. It only took 3 changes of the moon for military power in the realm to double. The knights of the castle had taken to raping women in the streets, putting insubordinate citizens to the sword where the stood, and claiming whatever they could as their own. Lomian was beginning to see, the Stranger had the right of it. The Realm was crumbling in the Iron Fist of his brother Kale.&lt;br /&gt;
Kale, in the midst of one of his rages, decided he would take the Realm of the Vines for his own. The elves were after inferior, and his new kingdom needed slaves. Lomian argued with his older brother for days, it was not right to invade a non-warring colony. Kale would not hear it, and Lomian was forced to submit, however, Lomian began to conceive a plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the sworn sword of the king, Lomian was to lead the Vanguard at the head of the army&amp;#8230;the first into battle. Having the most dangerous task Lomian demanded from Kale that he pick every single man in the Vanguard. Not seeing any harm in this Kale agreed, and Lomian began to hand pick the only people who he could trust&amp;#8230;those still claiming the ideals of his father, The Good King. They flew his banner, a Golden Eagle on a white field, and clad themselves all in white, symbolizing their purity from this new evil king. The rest of the men in Kales army flew a horrifying banner of a giant black bat with red eyes over a field of red. On the march a band of cloaked figures joined the King, these were emisarries from the Vryloka&amp;#8217;s cursed blood brothers&amp;#8230;vampires. It appeared that Kale had made a pact with the cursed bloods. Lomian had no love for the Black Brothers and decided it was time hatch his plan, it was early, but recent events forced his hand. That night, Lomian took the Van and flew for The Realm of the Vines to warn them of the coming attack. As the elves of the wood began setting their defences, Lomian sped on towards Asalia to beg for men. The King (Antovian Hareldi&amp;#8230; that is Antoban&amp;#8217;s great grand-father), touched by Lomian&amp;#8217;s courage, led the army out himself. Furthermore, he sent a raven to the dwarven colony in the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Battle Scene)&lt;br /&gt;
Kale&amp;#8217;s force consisted of 25,000 foot and 7,500 horse with 1,000 vampire warriors.&lt;br /&gt;
Alliance of the Free Folk 15,000 elves on foot 5,000 men on foot with 2,500 horse and 2000 dwarven foot soldiers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the fight Lomian cuts his way through the dark horde and finds Kale, giving in to the dark powers and feasting on a young elf&amp;#8217;s flesh. Lomian calls him out&amp;#8230;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPIC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIGHT&lt;/span&gt;. Infuriated, Lomian unleashes a blast of Arcane energy and his blade seems to sear flesh on contact. Witnesses say they could see the Flame of Justice in his eyes and it burned through the Horde. Songs were sung of his deeds, but his new found power frightened him, and he fled that night into the forest.

His respect for honor has earned him his deepest, darkest secret.  One hundred years ago, his guard brought in an old human who was found stealing apples from the marketplace.   

"Have you no honor?" the leader spoke.
"Believe me, your mighty, I know honor in ways that you never could," said the old man.
"Hold your tongue, old man.  Maybe you can find some of that honor in the cold dungeons beneath the Prime."  He then sent the old man to rot in the cold, dark dungeons beneath the fortress.

Three days later, Kriv was called to the old man's cell by some of his guards.  The old man was gone and all that remained were a few canary feathers.  Kriv realized his fault and filled with shame and guilt.  Every day since, he has looked for opportunities to right the wrongs of his past.

_Tristan Blackstone is a tall, broad-shouldered warrior with short brown hair and a thick brown beard.  He usually smells of tobacco as he smokes a good deal of [[popleaf]]._

Tristan does not intend to conquer Aestonia.  His one purpose is crushing Maransa to end the constant wars with them.  He strongly disagrees in a united empire and will fight to the death to oppose it.  

While in the Realm of the Vines, he discovered that the Cascades are hiding something.  They know the location of the lost Imperial City of Nerath. 

Tristan fully believes that the "old families" of the Cascades are too traditional.  Their ways will continue to lead the world into darkness.  He intends to "force back the darkness."  

A devout follower of Kord, Tristan gives uplifting speeches while rallying for battle and leads the charge like Alexander the Great.  "Even if it is not I that rules these lands, I will damn well make sure it isn't run by a breath of evil."  

"Today we march the fields against the darkest people to ever inhabit these lands.  Soak the fields with Maransan blood and end the tyranny of the Rising Fall!!!"

      <title>Stelian (R.I.P)</title>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile"></content>
      <content gm_only="false" format="html"></content>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Born a vryloka, Stelian, from a very young age, learned quickly to bluff his way out of most situations and to conceal the fact he was a pseudo-vampiric humanoid. Raised among bands of nomadic assassin's disguised as entertainers, Stelian killed his first man at about the age of 12 and was curiously good at it. The deaths never seemed to bother the boy. In his mind, people would all die eventually and be forever in the embrace of the Raven Queen. Though his philosophy seemed stark and dire to those who did not know him, Stelian actually had a firm sense of what was right or wrong, agreeing only to kill those he felt "earned" their spots in the afterlife early. Stelian believed that all his killings had a purpose and served to create a better cycle of life and death for the world.

With his very self assured and confident posture, though seemingly lost in thought and brooding when he is alone, Stelian is very shy among strangers, but prefers the company of good friends and is quick to trust those who show him kindness. He is very boisterous among friends and allies, reserved and almost silent when alone, and always sarcastic. Stelian is quick to anger, particularly when betrayed or a friend is betrayed, taking such matters personally. The Vryloka has no real love for law and order, feeling the only true law is the inevitability of death for his goddess the Raven Queen. He serves her faithfully but not zealously, and is very passionate about his mission to become so powerful in the ways of assassination that he transcends death itself, not to escape it, but to prove to the Raven Queen he is worthy and serve forever in her pantheon. 

"We all feel her embrace eventually. Tell me friend, when would you prefer to receive your's?" -Stelian to a group marauding cutthroats.</content>

      <title>Jinroy the Mindsinger</title>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">As with many a story, it starts with a humble beginning. A poor family of wandering minstrels enters the scene. They are family of Changelings. Mistrusted and shunned as potential assassins and spies, they assume the shape of humans, and make it their own. This allows them to entertain where it may be profitable. Their talents will eventually be recognized when one bears a child of unusual promise. This boy has the ability of the Psions. First, he amazed with simple card tricks where all he needed was to read the unwitting participant’s mind for the answer. He mastered the art of song and utilized his ability to augment his singing. By creating imprinting the sound of instruments in his watcher’s minds while he would sing, the effect of Bardic singing would be multiplied by the wonder of the mystery. He became known as Jinroy, the Mindsinger, and his minstrel party would entertain the finest halls and courts from sea to sea!

Jinroy became accustomed to the life at court. He became so accustomed as to have rivalries in the court. The Mindsinger had great pride and held on to his honor as an entertainer. When it was suggested that as an entertainer he was less worthy than a prostitute to be in court, Jinroy uttered a challenge so cutting that later it was said he drew the first blood before his sword left the scabbard. His victory initiated him into the dangerous and often deadly sport of dueling. He learned eagerly and soon became renowned not only for the flourish of his song but that of his rapier as well. 

Jinroy the Mindsinger soon blended the two and his rapier sang with his voice from the fencing chambers to the battlefield. His song trumpeted victory and inspired the troops forward with zeal! All the same it tolled gloom and confusion for the enemy, and they scattered or were destroyed. Those who faced the Mindsinger personally found they lost their minds before their lives.

And so the humble bard became a noble and earned himself an estate. It was small, but satisfied the needs of Jinroy and his family. They settled down, and while Jinroy would still entertain at court, his family could live as the Changelings they were born as. While battle brought him to this position, it spoiled his stomach for fighting. He became as famed for brokering peace among parties as he was for battlefield prowess. It is here the story would end if it weren’t for fate calling those who were needed. 

The Mindsinger expanded his studies as his thirst for bardic inspiration grew. When the world was silent apart from the turning of a tome’s pages, Music whispered to him, and he heeded its call. The Song of Heroes! Its haunting strains drifted through the halls and out down the road. This Song of Songs tugs at the heart of true Heroes everywhere and stirs them to awaken. Jinroy knew his purpose to be the instrument of the Song. Setting his affairs in order, Jinroy the Mindsinger left to fulfill his destiny.

His journey took him far across the wide World, and beyond it. He passed through the Fey, and into the Astral Sea. As he wanders the tumultuous plane he strengthens his psionic ability and leverages his natural changeling abilities to avoid being noticed. This allows him to pass through many realms relatively freely. Any situation he encounters often is dealt with words. Constantly he follows the refrain of the Song in order to find those who will inspire the words that will call mortal heroes forth to preserve Creation from those who seek to destroy it.

The blood of a thousand Eladrin had been soaked into the ground. The scorched earth was gladly drinking the offering.  The glade was tainted by a wild magic; trees laid bare, the underbrush burned to ash, the ground itself blackened.

Two young elves dressed in white flitted through the dead, examining each for signs of life. Each body was beyond any recognition.  As the elves were filtering through the endless piles of dead, they realized that there would be no living. Even the trees seemed to be withering around them. One of them looked atop a small hill. On that hill sat a lone Eladrin, Silmarien, he thought by the look of him.  Tall and elegant he was, clad all in blue.  His silvery hair tied back, not a hint of fatigue or distress on his face. He just stared blankly into the distance, over the elves’ heads. 

Slowly, his gaze turned towards the two young elf boys.  “Go back to your homes. There are none here left alive.” Silmarien spoke with a thin and airy, yet…demanding tone, a voice that left the two elves with fear clinging to their heart. The Eladrin then turned, with a subtle grace, towards his home. 



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



“There have been more and more disturbances.  I am not at all certain that they were initiated by those in the Feywilde.  That is the most discomforting”, said Silmarien as he paced the length of the council house.  “Elders, our home, nay, the realm, is under threat.  By what, I do not know, and I do not have the skill to see. The seer said something about distortion coming from The Fold. A region they call Aestonia. I will admit that I do not know anything about this place…”

“Your vision is clouded by your lust for battle.” Erevan, the leader of clan Sylvari, stood up suddenly and addressed Silmarien with the sternness they have all come to expect from him. 

“This council placed the clan under my protection, I would be neglecting my duties if I did not seek out threats to the Sylvari. I have given my last 80 years to the safekeeping of my people…” Silmarien started.

“The _safekeeping?_ You are more foolish than I thought. _Silmarien Sylvari_. When last you stood before us, not a year ago, did we not discuss the goings ons of our neighbors in the Fold? Did we not explain to you that the stars were disappearing? Did we not explain to you that the very fabric of this multi-verse is being slowly torn asunder? The safekeeping. You are but a child and you have brought shame to your name. If you are indeed interested in the safekeeping of your peoples, you will travel to the mortal world and help put an end to this.”

Silmarien did not say a word as he left the council house that day. Nor did he say a word in his travels to the Fold.  After weeks of searching, he finally caught up to the God’s Chosen, a band of mortals brought together for a single purpose, to bring peace back to The Fold.

      <content gm_only="false" format="html">&lt;p&gt;A cold chill clung to the morning dew of the old forest; a frigid early-spring breeze fluttered the newly formed buds on the trees. A pale beam of light broke pierced through the upper canopy. It illuminated the ghastly remains of the night previous. The dead lay everywhere.  The blood of a thousand Eladrin had been soaked into the ground. The scorched earth was gladly drinking the offering.  The glade was tainted by a wild magic; trees laid bare, the underbrush burned to ash, the ground itself blackened.&lt;/p&gt;

Each and every one reveals the secrets they have withheld over a thousand lifetimes.  Seemingly fixed, they watch over this world and all others.  Their power surpasses all understanding.  
	It was only a matter of time before one turned his eyes upward looking for the power within.  We just never thought it would happen so suddenly.  Even more frightening, word is spreading like wildfire that he succeeded.  I cannot imagine what it could do.  It should have never been attempted.  Should it fall into the hands of the likes of Orcus…that would be the end.  There is no question in my mind.

Rumors have come of his demise.  I know not what to believe but something tells me he is not dead.  No, not Starfire.  
	My most credible sources tell me that his journeys have taken him to the Astral Sea.  He has been seen in the Bright City of Hestavar.  This brings great joy to me if he has indeed made it.  But it also brings great distress.  That could mean he is closer to completing what he set out to do.

      <category>musical instrument</category>
      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Throughout the ages many have wondered how the impressive vaults of the mountain city of Minora were carved. Though average dwarves boast that it was through the sweat and blood of their ancestors that these halls were carved, it was  actually all thanks to one flute. Though lost to a sudden attack by drow, it was the ancestors of Morlan Thunderbeard who were once the owners of the flute. 

It is said that Thunderbeard's claim to fame was his booming voice that shook the very stone around him when he sang. These seemingly exaggerated tales actually speak a great truth, however the whole of which has been lost to time. Thunderbeard did, in fact, shake, shape, and mold the stone of Minora's halls with the use of Moradin's voice, for that is what none remember; it's power. 

Created by Moradin and gifted to his people, the flute holds mastery over stone for they who can play it. A simple tune on the flute, followed by a command can see stone walls split, statues carved in moments, or anything that the player can dream. 

Thankfully to any but the descendants of Morlan Thunderbeard it is a simple stone flute. Woe unto the world of man if the Voice were able to be used by any other...</content>

    Although most airships are powered by a magic propeller, some resemble sailing ships and are driven by magically created winds. An airship requires a crew of five (in addition to the pilot) to fly effectively. Including the gas balloon, this vessel is 10 squares long, 4 squares wide, and 5 squares tall.

The ship has no mounted weapons. It instead boasts a large cargo space which can be converted easily into living quarters.</content>

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">A feather capped figure and a hulking giant step out of the shadows and into the twilight of the port. There were many vessels moored in the rather uncouth and disheveled gallery of walkways and anchor posts. It was the perfect place to get lost, and therefore the perfect place to find the ship they were looking for.

Gauthak grunted and glared at a group of ruffians whose eyes had lingered on the pair for too long before looking questioningly at his friend. "This is where we will find the means to spread the tale of our companions?"

"Yes, it is." Assured Jinroy. The bard stood seemingly at ease among this crowd. "We need the fastest means to cross the Astral Sea and return to Aestonia. Pirates have the fastest ships."

The goliath nodded and looked back at the maze of hanging walkways among the galleys. It was only a matter of finding the fastest. The two companions were able to blend in easily enough. Jinroy altered his look to be more angled, with a chunk from his nose and a scar blinding one eye, which he left uncovered. Gauthak was menacing enough that those who would take a second look didn't for fear of bringing his wrath upon them.

They sat in taverns, listening to the conversations of scoundrels and smugglers, trying to figure out who had the fastest ship. Finally: "The Transcursus pulled into dock. That tiefling Solok Chans just got the best pickings on dromi spice for threading the needle." It was a burly duerger who spat on the floor with these words. His barmates were taken aback at these words.
"Thread the needle? Impossible!"
"The _Transcursus_ is quick, but no one is that quick..."
"I tell you it is true!" The duerger growled. "Bastard just pulled into dock weeks before anyone else has a chance to. They were unscathed. Only way you can go through that deathtrap of a crystal field is by threading the needle. Others are still goin 'round!"

Jinroy and Gauthak exchanged a look and strode over to the conversation. "Where is the _Transcursus_ moored?" Jinroy cut in.

"Who the fuck are you?" Spat the duerger.
"Someone with a job for a fast ship. Where is the _Transcursus_ moored?"
"Oy! You'll never afford it, blindy! Go fuck someone else's day!"

After Gauthak grabbed the dueger by the neck and heaved him into the ceiling the dazed dark dwarf was decidedly more docile.

"Eh.. bit a... in the middle.... dock of name Corsair Retreat..." As the duerger slumped unconsciously into his drink the pair left the tavern in haste.

They found the ship docked where it was supposed to be, and it was a beauty! Everything about it was built for speed. The balloons of magic air were lower than most others, and more elongated to lessen resistance. A mast poked up between the two balloons, offering a great vantage point as well as keeping the balloons firmly secure. Instead of a propeller or a sail, this airship had mixed both in a pair of intricate magical and mechanical wings like a swan's. These were currently flat against the boat. It was made of wood of the Feywild and must have started its life in a much more noble pursuit than smuggling. Unfortunately it now seemed somewhat diminished and sad. It slumped to one side as crates of spice were being loaded onto its deck.

The pair grimaced as they notice a pair of bodies swinging below the deck. The sign above them read, "The price of insubordination." A tiefling was supervising the loading of spice onto the ship, his whip's crack urging a pair of boys wearing tattered clothing to move faster.

"Hail! Captain Chans!" Halooed Jinroy. With a final crack the tiefling captain glared down the gangplank.
"Who might know me?"
"Ruthan and Rauthak at your service." Jinroy removed his hat and half bowed to the Captain, who noticeably appreciated the flattery.
"You wish to be in my service? How do you expect to serve me."
"Surely you could use a fine swordfighter and songsinger? Surely my companions physical prowess is needed on such a fine vessel?"
The tiefling paused, and then pulled a roll of parchment from inside his coat and presented it to them.
"This is your contract. You are loyal to me and to me only. You take orders from myself and my first mate, Belosh. You do what you are told when you are told or you will be hanged, You run from a fight and I'll kill you on the spot. You cheat your Captain or crewmates and we will throw you into the abyss of the Astral Sea. You do so until you are dead or I find someone better. You see the burned names? That's what happens to those who back down on the contract. Each man gets their cut."

With that he forced a quill into Jinroy's face, who signed and passed it onto Gauthak, who shot a glare at the bard before signing himself. After each had signed Captain Chans rolled up the parchment and replaced it in his coat. He then looked Gauthak up and down and said, "Load the spice." He then handed his whip to Jinroy and muttered, "Motivate the crew. I've got business to attend to."

The tiefling wandered down the dock towards the slum. Gauthak made short work of the remaining crates. Jinroy used the whip for sound effects while singing "Load em' Load em' Load em'/Get the spice all loaded/Load em' Load em' Load em'/Or die!"

Soon the loaded _Transcursus_ sped on through the Astral Sea, Belosh at the helm. The half-elf was grey and cut like an obsidian knife. He rarely spoke, but it was always in a murderously low voice when he did. Gauthak sat on deck while Jinroy went down below to get to know the crew. Down in the brig a Dark One watched over the two slaves. A song flowed in the minds of those in the brig that awoken the stirrings of the tattered humans ilif and ilik. The Dark One was taken unawares as his sight became blinded and his mind closed, he was barely able to scream before a rapier silenced him forever. The mutiny would start that night.

Jinroy, ilif, and ilik all advanced onto the deck in time to see Captain Solok Chans exit his private quarters with his Githyanki navigator. The loathing that spread across his face was palpable physically like a ray of heat. "Mutineers! Scum! There is a special hell for the likes of you! Let me send you there!"

The navigator retreated back to the private quarters as the Captain drew his scimitar and charged at the bard. Jinroy saluted and parried his opponent in one smooth motion, but suddenly took a bolt to the shoulder. Belosh aimed his deadly crossbow once more at the bard, but was blindsided by Gauthak. Unable to free himself from the goliath the half-elf could only scream in dismay as he was thrown into the abyss that is the Astral Sea. Once more Captain Chans struck at Jinroy, who barely managed to dodge. The bard caught the Captain with a counter attack the ran through his chest, and cursing the Captain fell dead.

The navigator was found cowering behind a map table. "Please! Please don't kill me! I had no choice! Please!"
"No need for that. I need you to take us to The Fold."
"The Fold...? Yes. Yes! I can do that! Please just spare me!"
"You have my word no harm will come to you so long as you navigate for me faithfully."
"Oh, thank you! I will not let you down!"

Gauthak rolled his eyes at the cowardice, and Jinroy grew stern.

"What is your name?"
"Weillace! Oh Captain!"
"Weillace. You have the right to chose to be my navigator. I will not harm you either way. Please lend me your skill however, my world is in the tottering on the brink of destruction. Only my companions can bring it balance! Please have the courage to go where I ask you."

Weillace was taken aback, and emboldened with sudden cause as a song wafted in the back of his mind.

"I am loyal to you, Captain. I will have courage."

ilif and ilik were given proper clothing and fed well. They agreed to stay on as crew. Gauthak makes a convincing First Mate, and Weillace is more than competent at his art of navigation. It was not a full crew, but enough to reach where they might find others to assist them. 

Jinroy's instinct is to go back to the beginning of the tale, and from there he shall rejoin his companions whether in the flesh or revered in song. He reaches Stallcroft and drops Gauthak off to find their companions. However he needs a larger crew in order for their ship to be truly airworthy. He stops at the Lied Estate, and is joined by his talented sister Jinein, his rebellious brother Jintal, and their Grandfather Nalrie the thief. This gives him a crew more than sufficient to travel through Aestonia. His family also assists in cleaning up the _Transcursus_ back to its shining glory, worthy of flying into court!</content>
      <content gm_only="false" format="html">&lt;p&gt;A feather capped figure and a hulking giant step out of the shadows and into the twilight of the port. There were many vessels moored in the rather uncouth and disheveled gallery of walkways and anchor posts. It was the perfect place to get lost, and therefore the perfect place to find the ship they were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gauthak grunted and glared at a group of ruffians whose eyes had lingered on the pair for too long before looking questioningly at his friend. &amp;#8220;This is where we will find the means to spread the tale of our companions?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes, it is.&amp;#8221; Assured Jinroy. The bard stood seemingly at ease among this crowd. &amp;#8220;We need the fastest means to cross the Astral Sea and return to Aestonia. Pirates have the fastest ships.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goliath nodded and looked back at the maze of hanging walkways among the galleys. It was only a matter of finding the fastest. The two companions were able to blend in easily enough. Jinroy altered his look to be more angled, with a chunk from his nose and a scar blinding one eye, which he left uncovered. Gauthak was menacing enough that those who would take a second look didn&amp;#8217;t for fear of bringing his wrath upon them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They sat in taverns, listening to the conversations of scoundrels and smugglers, trying to figure out who had the fastest ship. Finally: &amp;#8220;The Transcursus pulled into dock. That tiefling Solok Chans just got the best pickings on dromi spice for threading the needle.&amp;#8221; It was a burly duerger who spat on the floor with these words. His barmates were taken aback at these words.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;Thread the needle? Impossible!&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;The &lt;em&gt;Transcursus&lt;/em&gt; is quick, but no one is that quick&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;I tell you it is true!&amp;#8221; The duerger growled. &amp;#8220;Bastard just pulled into dock weeks before anyone else has a chance to. They were unscathed. Only way you can go through that deathtrap of a crystal field is by threading the needle. Others are still goin &amp;#8217;round!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jinroy and Gauthak exchanged a look and strode over to the conversation. &amp;#8220;Where is the &lt;em&gt;Transcursus&lt;/em&gt; moored?&amp;#8221; Jinroy cut in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Who the fuck are you?&amp;#8221; Spat the duerger.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;Someone with a job for a fast ship. Where is the &lt;em&gt;Transcursus&lt;/em&gt; moored?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;#8220;Oy! You&amp;#8217;ll never afford it, blindy! Go fuck someone else&amp;#8217;s day!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Gauthak grabbed the dueger by the neck and heaved him into the ceiling the dazed dark dwarf was decidedly more docile.&lt;/p&gt;

      <content gm_only="false" format="textile">Odo the Brash, or Strongarm as many of the clan called him, gazed out into the still nothingness of the night. A strong wind from the North Sea tore its way across the mountainside.  Odo grunted and spit, knowing full well that with winter coming the passes out of the mountains would soon be impassable.  The howl of the wind was loud enough to drown out any sound of the festivities behind him, and he was thankful for that. Odo glanced behind him, “Fucking giglets,” he spat, and with that, he turned once more to his watch.

	Deep in the cave, a celebration was in full swing.  This was the most bountiful harvest on record for the Ankkath peoples.  Several bonfires were alight, spread throughout the enormous ceremonial cave.  Pipes and drums filled the air with upbeat music; there was dancing, singing and other forms of merry making.  A happier place in the Fold could not be found.  

	Near the central fire, an old and grizzled man known as Arminio, stood and raised his hand. The entire cavern fell to a hush immediately.  “We thank the Gods for this most generous of harvests,” his voiced thundered off the cavern walls, “however, there is a long winter ahead.  We need to be steadfast and unyielding as we have always been. There is war in the far south, and the Great Power of old has once again risen.  Come Summer, and they could very well be on our doorstep.” With that comment, many people shifted uncomfortably where the sat. Seeing that his words were not altogether well received, Arminio changed the subject, “Enough of the future, tonight, we feast!!” With that he clapped his hands and hundreds of hands carried out trays of bread and meat, piled high and smoking.  Cheers went up from the crowd, and the fest was begun.

	Hours later, Arminio stood once more.  This time however, he did not raise his hand.  He took some powder from his belt pouch and threw it on the fire. The flame was extinguished and then burst forth once more in a kaleidoscope of color.  Turning from blue to green, green to purple the fire was a sight to behold!  Arminio closed his eyes and started chanting, soon the fires around the caverns started to dim without losing any intensity.  The whole clan joined in the chanting and soon the walls seemed to sing as well.  The cavern was alive with the Ankkath’s song of Stone.  Arminio silenced the crowd with the raising of his hand, “Brothers, Sisters, young ones.  I want to tell you the story of the Sun Stone on this cold and bitter night.” When Arminio started his story, the fires around the cavern became alive with images of his tale, and the howling outside seemed to drop to nothing.  All that could be heard was his voice.  A low hum droned from the rock, almost ampliefied by this shaman’s voice…

	_Long ago, in the first days of this world, there was only darkness.  Darkness filled the sea, it covered the land, and it smothered the sky.  With this, all the light in the cave went out. But, awake! The Gods shone light upon this earth. First, the sky was given light to breathe, then the darkness was taken out of the sea, and at long last a single ray of light shone upon the Fold.  The central fire now shone with a bright, white light. The beauty of the earth was revealed! Lo! How the land was wrapped in such beauty, now visible to the Gods, and they were glad. This first beam of light that ever touched the Fold struck a stone.  It is said that this stone still shines with the power of the Sun, and it holds within itself the power of the Sun, giving warmth and strength to the one who carries it. The one who carries it can restore their allies vitality and vigor with not but a single word.  It is also said to be the only thing that can truly destroy the Winter Witch who brings the wretched cold down upon us._

At this point, the fires returned to normal, and the howling of the wind resumed once more.  Now, the shaman looked graven, “My people, I believe we need this stone to survive.  The winters are turning ever more cruel, and the darkness is deepening all around us. The stone will sustain us. I am sure of it. Who will go?”

Silence.

Suddenly from the entrance of the cave, Odo shouted, “Fuck it. I’ll go find your shiny stone and kill the bitch, Old man.”

Odo left that cave months ago…he has not been heard from since.

The flame was extinguished and then burst forth once more in a kaleidoscope of color.  Turning from blue to green, green to purple the fire was a sight to behold!  Arminio closed his eyes and started chanting, soon the fires around the caverns started to dim without losing any intensity.  The whole clan joined in the chanting and soon the walls seemed to sing as well.  The cavern was alive with the Ankkath’s song of Stone.  Arminio silenced the crowd with the raising of his hand, “Brothers, Sisters, young ones.  I want to tell you the story of the Sun Stone on this cold and bitter night.” When Arminio started his story, the fires around the cavern became alive with images of his tale, and the howling outside seemed to drop to nothing.  All that could be heard was his voice.  A low hum droned from the rock, almost ampliefied by this shaman’s voice…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long ago, in the first days of this world, there was only darkness.  Darkness filled the sea, it covered the land, and it smothered the sky.  With this, all the light in the cave went out. But, awake! The Gods shone light upon this earth. First, the sky was given light to breathe, then the darkness was taken out of the sea, and at long last a single ray of light shone upon the Fold.  The central fire now shone with a bright, white light. The beauty of the earth was revealed! Lo! How the land was wrapped in such beauty, now visible to the Gods, and they were glad. This first beam of light that ever touched the Fold struck a stone.  It is said that this stone still shines with the power of the Sun, and it holds within itself the power of the Sun, giving warmth and strength to the one who carries it. The one who carries it can restore their allies vitality and vigor with not but a single word.  It is also said to be the only thing that can truly destroy the Winter Witch who brings the wretched cold down upon us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, the fires returned to normal, and the howling of the wind resumed once more.  Now, the shaman looked graven, “My people, I believe we need this stone to survive.  The winters are turning ever more cruel, and the darkness is deepening all around us. The stone will sustain us. I am sure of it. Who will go?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly from the entrance of the cave, Odo shouted, “Fuck it. I’ll go find your shiny stone and kill the bitch, Old man.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odo left that cave months ago…he has not been heard from since.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

        <content format="textile">I say we call it The Fold for two reasons. 1. Fold means "earth" in Hungarian 2. The Fold also implicates the relationship the middle world has with each of the nether regions, the earth is where all the planes sort of "meet" or intersect and so I think "The Fold" is an appropriate and very fitting name. It also sounds cool. Bonus.</content>

Our world is a unique one, it consists of many places in the D&amp;D campaign settings as well as our own, Aestonia.  But what are we to call this world?  Let's start a brainstorm of names.

        <content format="textile">I agree with the first part of your post yet also believe it opens up a roleplaying opportunity.  There are plenty of factions, people, and kingdoms you guys have connections to or are aware of.  SIDE QUEST ALERT!  Maybe you need to explore and find these people within your network somehow.  Forge alliances, offer trades, make deals to aid your quest.  Great way to meet others like yourselves.  

To your secondary thought:
I love it.  A short rest is meant to be 5-30 minutes game time.  There is no reason we can't spend 5-10 or however many minutes acting that out.  One of the best ideas so far.  Phenomenal roleplaying idea that I believe aids Neal's idea perfectly for forging stronger relationships.  </content>

        <content format="textile">Ar this point it seems like our pace is keeping us from strong role playing. It's hard to do a fun conversation with a barkeep or even amongst ourselves with the ever present threat of war. I think it might be a good idea to have some more heroes in the world. We can't possibly be the only ones who are capable of handling the stuff that faces us. 

As a secondary thought, I think it would be awesome if we role played rests. Short and long we breeze over what are great times to learn backstory on characters. Tales of lore, and places where we build friendship and trust. We all talk to each other as though we trust our teammates implicitly, lets use the time we spend patching ourselves up and sharpening our weapons to build friendships and the world. I know a lot of this stuff is on OP, but that doesn't mean everyone has time or presence of mind to read it. </content>

        <content format="textile">Greetings everyone! I have an idea that might take this to the next level, or you might hate it if you are someone who likes to beat RPG's in as short a time as possible (Cole). I think if we took more opportunities to take on side stories, our world would open up so much more.  Even doing ordinary things like opening up a tavern in Asalia or going back to Maetrage to get the Eladrin girl. There are many possibilities to not only develop the world, but to develop our characters and our character's relationships with each other. Food for thought!</content>

        <content format="textile">I apologize if I'm just hounding on the roleplaying but I think it'll truly take our game to the next level.  I have plenty of ideas on how to make the roleplaying better but I want to hear some ideas from you guys.  Let's use this forum thread to brainstorm on ideas for roleplaying, how it can be better, random ideas, what's working, what's not, etc.  Post ideas here and I'll reward you in the form of XP, magic items, or session bonuses.</content>
